As such, if you downloaded this from a website not on this list, 
please consider redownloading so you can be sure you have everything. 
Also, please send me a message so I can inspect it myself.

If you downloaded it, please make sure you got it from one of the 
official websites listed above. It ensures you have the latest, 
up-to-date version, and cuts down on the chance of an outdated 
version being released. It also makes it easier for me to give you 
bug support help if you're using a current version.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TA02. SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This game was created in RPG Maker XP, a computer program that allows 
you to create RPG-genre games on the computer, compatible for the 
Computer only. As such, Touhoumon Asteria will NOT be compatible 
with any Game Boy Advance emulator, DS Emulator, or any Handheld 
emulator of the sort. Please do not ask me how to make it compatible 
with any emulator, there is no way to do so. 

On the same note, please do not ask me how to play it on an Android 
Phone/iPhone/Whatever smart phone you may possess. The same applies as
above, there is no way to play Touhoumon Asteria on a Smartphone.

While there have been efforts in recent times to get Essentials-made
games to work on mobile devices, I am not aware of the process behind
this, as Asteria was made as a PC game. I cannot help with getting the
game working on mobile devices.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TA03. IMPORTANT INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Please do not mess with the system files, they help keep the game
running stable. If you need something addressed, please send me a
message so I can help you- my contact information will be below.
If you mess with the files, and the game manages to break, I am not
responsible for what breaks. I will not be able to help you fix the
game, and the only advice I can give is to start a new game.

There are documents in the folder labeled "A Useful Folder Full of 
Useful Things" which provide information about certain subjects, 
including shortcuts to the forum threads, the official 1.8 Wiki,
both an on/offine verson of the 1.8 Type Chart and the Touhoumon
Essentials type chart, as well as text documents created by both
Agastya and Derxwna in regards to 1.8 mechanics and concepts.

Do not get too attached to your save file, and be prepared to start a
new save file at any time. Changes to internal coding, the way 
certain events are handled, and the various phases of the moon may
render your existing save file broken, and will require a full 
restart.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TA04. GAME INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Touhoumon Asteria is a game built around the Essentials Game Engine
for RPG Maker XP, with the 1.8 generation of Touhou Puppet Play at
its core. It fuses the aforementioned generation of TPP with the
mechanics of the Fourth+ Generation of the parent franchise. 

Asteria is a somewhat untraditional fangame, focusing more on plot
than on becoming a Master Trainer or completing the dex. As such, the
Gym Challenge is an optional part of the game. With the redesign,
the world should be accessable to the player from the start. 
Certain areas might be blocked off because of main or side quest
progression, but this is to be expected of most games. If you
notice any issues with an area you shouldn't be able to access yet,
please contact me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

TA06. BUGS AND UNFINISHED THINGS IN THE CURRENT RELEASE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
EVERYTHING IS SHITCODE I AM A TERRIBLE PROGRAMMER! :wackospin:

The game may lag on some older machines, due to how much information 
the game has to process from the internal scripts. Aside from that, 
there are no other bugs I am aware of currently. 

Some move effects may be incorrect with their 1.8 counterparts. If
you notice any inconsistencies in move effects, abilities, items,
or even Puppets, please report it to me immediately, regardless of
whether or not you think someone else may have reported it or not.

Remember: A reported bug eventually* gets fixed, an unreported bug
stays unnoticed forever.
