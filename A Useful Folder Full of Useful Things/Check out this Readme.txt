As such, if you downloaded this from a website not on this list, 
please consider redownloading so you can be sure you have everything. 
Also, please send me a message so I can inspect it myself.

If you downloaded it, please make sure you got it from one of the 
official websites listed above. It ensures you have the latest, 
up-to-date version, and cuts down on the chance of an outdated 
version being released. It also makes it easier for me to give you 
bug support help if you're using a current version.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TE02. SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This game was created in RPG Maker XP, a computer program that allows 
you to create RPG-genre games on the computer, compatible for the 
Computer only. As such, Touhoumon Essentials will NOT be compatible 
with any Game Boy Advance emulator, DS Emulator, or any Handheld 
emulator of the sort. Please do not ask me how to make it compatible 
with any emulator, there is no way to do so. 

On the same note, please do not ask me how to play it on an Android 
Phone/iPhone/Whatever smart phone you may possess. The same applies as
above, there is no way to play Touhoumon Essentials on a Smartphone. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TE03. IMPORTANT INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Feel free to get messy with the system files if you wanna rip the kit
apart and figure out how things work! I may not be able to offer you
the most in-depth technical assistance, but I can provide whatever
help I can! If you break something, though, my best suggestion is to
redownload the kit (or better, make a backup somewhere- this is a
development kit, why aren't you making more backups as you work?)

There are documents in the folder labeled "A Useful Folder Full of 
Useful Things" which provide information about certain subjects, 
including shortcuts to the forum threads, the official 1.8 Wiki,
both an on/offine verson of the 1.8 Type Chart and the Touhoumon
Essentials type chart, as well as text documents created by both
Agastya and Derxwna in regards to 1.8 mechanics and concepts.

If for whatever reason you care about your save file within the
DevKit's micro game, please take note that a future update to the
DevKit may render that save file broken. If that happens, there will
be a notice on my blog and the relevant threads.

TE04. GAME INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Touhoumon Essentials is a a development kit built on the Essentials 
Game Engine for RPG Maker XP. It comes with Generation I-IV for its
core franchise (With Generation V moves and stats), as well as the
mechanics of Touhou Puppet Play Generation 1.812x developed by
Hemoglobin A1c. The kit allows individuals to make their own Touhoumon
fangame outside of the need to utilize ROM Hacking. There are a few
differences to vanilla 1.8, most notably Puppets of the Touhou Project
characters from Touhou 13: Ten Desires up to, and including, 
Touhou 14.5: Urban Legend in Limbo. Several of these new Puppets, as
well as tweaked older ones, come from Touhoumon Purple, made by
Agastya, and Touhoumon Unnamed, made by DoesntKnowHowToPlay. The DevKit
also features a fully functional, if perhaps excessive, 34 Type Chart
system, to allow Pokemon and Puppet mechanics to function 
independantly of one another.

Within Touhoumon Essentials is a Micro-Game that revolves around
Red, and takes place during the events of Touhoumon Faith & Prayer
Version. The events of this game are dubiously canonical at best, but
it shows a small xample of what can be done with the engine.

TE06. BUGS AND UNFINISHED THINGS IN THE CURRENT RELEASE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
EVERYTHING IS SHITCODE I AM A TERRIBLE PROGRAMMER! :wackospin:

The game may lag on some older machines, due to how much information 
the game has to process from the internal scripts. Aside from that, 
there are no other bugs I am aware of currently. 

Some move effects may be incorrect with their 1.8 counterparts. If
you notice any inconsistencies in move effects, abilities, items,
or even Puppets, please report it to me immediately, regardless of
whether or not you think someone else may have reported it or not.

Remember: A reported bug eventually* gets fixed, an unreported bug
stays unnoticed forever.
