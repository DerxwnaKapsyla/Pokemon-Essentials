TFoC01. OFFICIAL DOWNLOAD LINKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Links to the official downloads can be found at the following locations:
	* (Relic Castle link will be added in 1.1)
	* https://chaoticinfinitydev.tumblr.com/

As such, if you downloaded this from a website not on this list, 
please consider redownloading so you can be sure you have everything. 
Also, please send me a message so I can inspect it myself.

If you downloaded it, please make sure you got it from one of the 
official websites listed above. It ensures you have the latest, 
up-to-date version, and cuts down on the chance of an outdated 
version being released. It also makes it easier for me to give you 
bug support help if you're using a current version.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TFoC02. SYSTFoCM COMPATIBILITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This game was created in RPG Maker XP, a computer program that allows 
you to create RPG-genre games on the computer, compatible for the 
Computer only. As such, Touhoumon Essentials will NOT be compatible 
with any Game Boy Advance emulator, DS Emulator, or any Handheld 
emulator of the sort. Please do not ask me how to make it compatible 
with any emulator, there is no way to do so. 

On the same note, please do not ask me how to play it on an Android 
Phone/iPhone/Whatever smart phone you may possess. The same applies as
above, there is no stable way to play RMXP games on a Smartphone (yet.) 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TFoC03. IMPORTANT INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I highly suggest avoiding messing with the system files. If something
breaks because you thought it'd be a fun idea to try and add in a third
party script that I didn't intend for, I won't be able to help you.

There are documents in the folder labeled "A Useful Folder Full of 
Useful Things" which provide information about certain subjects, 
including shortcuts to the forum threads, the official 1.8 Wiki,
both an on/offine verson of the 1.8 Type Chart and the Touhoumon
Essentials type chart, as well as text documents created by both
Agastya and Derxwna in regards to 1.8 mechanics and concepts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TFoC04. GAME INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Touhou Puppet Play ~ The Festival of Curses is a a Fangame made for the
Relic Castle Winter Game Jam 2,  built on the Essentials Game Engine for 
RPG Maker XP. It is based off of the Touhoumon Essentials Development 
Kit, built off Essentials, and is based on the 1.8 generation of 
Touhoumon, while also adopting Gen 6-ish mechanics from the core 
franchise.

The game revolves around the player character, Ayaka, as she partakes
of the Harvest Festival that the Human Village is holding. However, it
would seem that not everything in the Village is as it should be. What
exactly is going on, and just who is behind this Festival of Curses?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TFoC06. BUGS AND UNFINISHED THINGS IN THE CURRENT RELEASE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
EVERYTHING IS SHITCODE I AM A TERRIBLE PROGRAMMER! :wackospin:

The game may lag on some older machines, due to how much information 
the game has to process from the internal scripts. There is also lag on
certain maps when using the Turbo script. Besides that, I cannot think
of any other specific issues.

If you are familiar with Touhoumon 1.8 mechanics, some move effects 
may be incorrect with their 1.8 counterparts. If you notice any 
inconsistencies in move effects, abilities, items, or even Puppets, 
please report it to me immediately, regardless of whether or not you 
think someone else may have reported it or not.

Remember: A reported bug eventually* gets fixed, an unreported bug
stays unnoticed forever.

There were several things scrapped from the 1.0 release of the game
due to the time limit of the Game Jam. These things will be present
in future releases. Things you can look forward to:
* The Festival Tournament, where you can battle in four different tiers
of difficulty and be awarded Festival Points for completion.
* Keine's Quiz Hall, where you can put your knowledge of the world of
Touhou to the test, also for Festival Points.
* Prismriver Haunted House, where you can travel around the spooky
Prismriver Estatae to capture rare and unique Puppets... But be warned,
you might find yourself becoming cursed in the process...!
* More shops to spend Festival Points on
* Possibly more minigames idk
