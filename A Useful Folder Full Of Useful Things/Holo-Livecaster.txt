Hey there! Did you know, you can activate New Game+ on a fresh save
file by putting in "Ayaka2" as the player's name?

It'll make it so you're automatically in "Loop 1" of the game state,
and therefore affect all Trainers and Wild Puppets you'll find by
making them stronger!

The starter won't be affected, so you'll have to catch some new
Puppets immediately, or you'll have to grind. To make up for 
this, NG+ will also start the player with 20 Rare Candies upon
loading in, as well as one of each evolution stone. You will
also be given a bonus Puppet in the form of the MagicStones,
as being in this state will cancel out the event in the World
of Fantasies.

There may or may not be other "passwords" done the same way,
but nothing game altering!

I really hope you enjoy the game, I tried my hardest to make it
an enjoyable experience. I would really appreciate any feedback
you may have to offer. Until we next meet,
