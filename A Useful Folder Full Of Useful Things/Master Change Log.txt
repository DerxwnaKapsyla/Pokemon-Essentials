TAoA Things to Fix or Do
- Add in an "Origin Sounds" item, which is similar to GB Sounds; it'll play the original tracks from TMoM
	* This is assuming that I replace them with later generation style tracks
- Figure out why the Change BGM plugin only changes the BGM of the map you're on if you reload from a save
- Add the Defeat Counter into the save UI
- Add Door to Alice's house
