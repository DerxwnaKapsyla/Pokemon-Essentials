TAoA Things to Fix or Do
https://i.imgur.com/Zejykjm.png

DevKit/Asteria/TAoA/Etc fixes:
* Konngara's sprite is named wrong
* AdRan has Kagerou's cry
1. Puppet Toxic is not guaranteed to hit with miasma types 
2. Skill Cards and Hidden Cards dont show up with their icons
A bunch of moves have incomplete function codes in moves.txt
- Rage
- Thrash
- Recollection
- Weather Ball
- Lock On
- Mana Shield
- Gehaburn

Known Issues:
Defeat Count carries over between saves (for now, hopefully)
BGM Change doesn't work perfectly on v20.1; it only changes the bgm of the map you're on if you reload from a save at any point before the bgm changes.
