--- Prefixes and Information ---

Because I like my hyper organization, I have made it so audio tracks follow a specific format
in the folder. This format is explained below.

- If a track is prefixed with "U", it is a Utility Track. These range from things such as the
  Evolution theme, or the Capture Fanfare. 
- If a track is prefixed with "B", it is a Battle track. These are tracks used when fighting
  Trainers or in Wild Encounters. 
- If a track is prefixed with "W", it is an Overworld Track. These are tracks used for the
  world at large, such as your cities and dungeons. They can also be designated this way if
  they fufill an ambient need.
- Pre-Battle themes are not stored in the root BGM folder, and will instead be stored in a
  folder called "Intros". The tracks there will have the "P" prefix, denoted for Pre-Battle.
  All Pre-Battle tracks WILL need to be placed in this folder for the tracks to play properly.

- All tracks will be loop compatable with the FModEx plugin by Nuru Yuri.


You obviously don't need to adhere to this formula, it's just how I organize things!
