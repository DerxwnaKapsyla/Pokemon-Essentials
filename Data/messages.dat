You should have repoted this immediately!"k\xn[Akyuu]Perhaps, due to how abrupt it was, my own judgment was impared, and for that I do apologize."|\xn[Mr. Kirisame]You're damn right it was! We may have been able to deal with this before it put the entire village at risk!"G\xn[Keine]Mr. Kirisame, I must ask you to please compose yourself."±\xn[Keine]While Akyuu's actions may not have been the most ideal, it is very unlikely that even if she had reported this beforehand that we could have done anything substantial."V\xn[Keine]No doubt this curse was lain on the village in the late hours of night."x\xn[Keine]If anything, we should inquire with the patrol on duty last night to see if they saw anything suspicious."o\xn[Keine]I suppose I should ask, just to be sure. Did you four happen to see anything strange last night?"q\xn[Maya]Just because we leave the village at night on occasion doesn't mean we leave it <i>every</i> night!"o\xn[Shinji]Regardless, no. One of us would have spoken up if we saw or heard anything abnormal last night."ï\xn[Shinji]That is part of our current agreement that allows us to leave the Village at night, afterall. To report our activities to you, Miss Keine."H\xn[Keine]Never hurt to ask... Still, this leaves us at square one."à\xn[Keine]Miss Minoriko, I'm not sure if dealing with curses is your specialty, but how well do you think you can handle this situation?"ã\xn[Minoriko]Without seeing the crops themselves, it's hard to say... But if they have been cursed, then it'll be much harder to deal with."m\xn[Minoriko]I can probably try and slow the curses down, but I won't be able to do much more than that."S\xn[Minoriko]However, there is someone more fit to deal with curses than I am."è\xn[Minoriko]At the base of Youkai Mountain is where a fellow Goddess resides. She's exceptional at dealing with Curses and general Misfortune."Ç\xn[Minoriko]However, she tends to not leave her domain often. The curses and misfortune that circle around her are very powerful."~\xn[Minoriko]If she were here though, she could probably easily dispell any curse that is aflicting the Village and its crops."k\xn[Keine]And you're sure that this Curse Goddess could resolve this if we manage to get ahold of her?"D\xn[Minoriko]She should be able to dispel it at the very least!"Ä\xn[Mr. Kirisame]Then we have our plan. All we have to do is get ahold of this Goddess and enlist her aid in curing the Village."^\xn[Minoriko]Precisely. In that case, I should be off so I can get in contact with her..."Z\xn[Maya]Wait, Miss Minoriko! If you go, nobody will be left to attend to your stall!"Å\xn[Maya]And if you, the cornerstone of this entire festival, are missing, then people will immediately sense something is amiss!"a\xn[Minoriko]I suppose you have a point, but... there's nobody else who can really go, then."q\xn[Maya]Well, I wouldn't say there's <i>nobody</i> left. I can think of someone who can probably handle it."-\xn[Minoriko]Oh! I suppose that is true!"9\xn[\pn]W-Wait! Y-You don't mean <i>me</i>, do you!?"`\xn[Kota]Honestly, I can't think of anybody else who fits the bill better than you do, \pn!"J\xn[Kota]Mext to Maya, you're the most active go-getter of our group!"í\xn[Shinji]You also held your own against Miss Minoriko during the exhibition match earlier. Easily proof that you're capable of holding your own."Ä\xn[Farmer]Surely you jest! She's but a child, sending her out of the village into what is effectively No-Man's Land is suicide!"g\xn[Maya]Again, we aren't children!

If you can brave a mansion full of ghosts, a forest full of magical experiments gone wild, and everything else we've seen on our adventures, you can totally handle a trip across the lake!"R\xn[\pn]Well\..\..\..\wt[20] And you give your approval for this, Miss Keine?"ß\xn[Keine]It's not something I would have considered in the past, but you have proven time and time again that you are both mature and capable enough of handling this."E\xn[Keine]As such, you have my full support and endorsment here."Ñ\xn[\pn]I guess...

Were you harassed by the fairies on the way over?"'\xn[\pn]Nothing I couldn't handle!"F\xn[Keine]Great, now take a seat and let's go over the situation."x\xn[Keine]So, first off, well done on returning with Miss Kagiyama, \pn. I knew it was a good idea to trust in you."N\xn[\pn]Aw, you flatter me! But really, it was my pleasure to be of help."\xn[\pn]So, what exactly is going on with the Village? I hit the Village entrance and I see fairies charging through the roads."e\xn[Keine]Well, not long after you left, we started seeing more and more fairies in the Village."™\xn[Keine]Initially, we thought these fairies could have been responsible for the curse laid on the village, but that would have been extremely out of character for them.">\xn[Keine]Still, we kept an eye on them as best we could."w\xn[Keine]However, we were starting to notice that there were more fairies than we could reasonably keep track of."w\xn[Akyuu]Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be an issue. Fairies tnd to frequent the village fairly often."ñ\xn[Keine]Right. But, the problems started arising when the Fairies begun to do coordinated pranks and challenge Puppet Handlers to battles in swarms."o\xn[Keine]This wouldn't seem like an issue, but whenever one was dealt with, another three took its place."ã\xn[Keine]While most of the festival-goers are just assuming this is part of the festival, a lot of villagers are understandably concerned."†\xn[Akyuu]Fairies are known to play pranks on the villagers, but on such a scale is practically unheard of, even with all my years of writing for the Chronicle."L\xn[Hina]This does sound like the situation in the Great Youkai Forest."{\xn[Hina]The area of the Forest that I reside in is home to malevolent spirits and lingering curses, nothing abnormal."{\xn[Hina]However, as of recent, the spirits there begun to act up, possessing the local Puppets and causing general mayhem."|\xn[Hina]They even managed to possess me for a brief period!

I hit the Village entrance and I see fairies charging through the roads."e\xn[Keine]Well, not long after you left, we started seeing more and more fairies in the Village."™\xn[Keine]Initially, we thought these fairies could have been responsible for the curse laid on the village, but that would have been extremely out of character for them.">\xn[Keine]Still, we kept an eye on them as best we could."w\xn[Keine]However, we were starting to notice that there were more fairies than we could reasonably keep track of."w\xn[Akyuu]Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be an issue. Fairies tnd to frequent the village fairly often."ñ\xn[Keine]Right. But, the problems started arising when the Fairies begun to do coordinated pranks and challenge Puppet Handlers to battles in swarms."o\xn[Keine]This wouldn't seem like an issue, but whenever one was dealt with, another three took its place."ã\xn[Keine]While most of the festival-goers are just assuming this is part of the festival, a lot of villagers are understandably concerned."†\xn[Akyuu]Fairies are known to play pranks on the villagers, but on such a scale is practically unheard of, even with all my years of writing for the Chronicle."L\xn[Hina]This does sound like the situation in the Great Youkai Forest."{\xn[Hina]The area of the Forest that I reside in is home to malevolent spirits and lingering curses, nothing abnormal."{\xn[Hina]However, as of recent, the spirits there begun to act up, possessing the local Puppets and causing general mayhem."|\xn[Hina]They even managed to possess me for a brief period!

For as long as the demonic pulse beats in this island's heart, my power shall not be exhausted.\n-DerxwnaKapsyla"4They seem to be focused on the screen intently."4Touhoumon Generation 1.8: Information and Games"Read on?"Touhoumon Generation 1.8 was a radical shift in the Touhoumon department. It was the introduction of several new concepts, and mechanics. The most noteable addition was the Diamond/Pearl Skill Split System, or more as it's called in English communities, the Physical/Special Split."Alongside the Physical/Special Split came a completely overhauled type chart, featuring several new types that weren't in Pokemon (Such as Faith, Dream, Illusion, Heart), and replacing some of the older types with the new ones (Like Dragon, Bug, Normal, and Fighting)."ΩThe 1.8 Generation also had a more streamlined evolution system. Unlike the previkous Touhoumon generations, where Touhoumon would evolve in 3 Stages (Chibi-Normal-EX), with some special evolutions, (Final, Advent, Last Word, this system had Touhoumon evolve from Chibi into several different forms. A vast majority of Puppets have Shard Evolutions, which evolve them into specialized forms, such as Attack Forms, Defense Forms, and Speed Forms."«There are other, more non-specific, stone roles, such as Helper Forms, Technical Forms, and Advent Forms. These roles cover a much different playstyle than the basic Attack, Defense, and Speed roles."Continue reading?"ÄDespite its massive changes - or maybe it's in spite of - Generation 1.8 has been the least hacked of the Touhoumon generations."ÖThough, the hacks that have been made on the 1.8 Engine are rather well known ones: Touhoumon Purple and Touhou Puppet Play Enhanced."5Touhoumon Purple, developed by Agastya, is a hack of Pokemon Emerald. It does not change the plot, but it does tweak the level curve to make the game just a bit more challenging for players. Unlike other Emerald-based hacks in general, Purple has a complete and functioning Battle Frontier and Contest system."Touhou Puppet Play Enhanced is developed by Aichiya Sanae, developer of the prolific 1.5 hacks, World Link and Another World. This hack was based off Fire Red, and as a result features Kanto. However, unlike most other common Touhoumon hacks, this one features Johto in the postgame."øGeneration 1.8 brought about the most change to the system, but had little in the room of development. To be expected, since this was the last official Touhoumon release by Hemo and his team."Niche Touhoumon Games"ÕTouhoumon has inspired other developers to make Touhoumon games of their own. However, some of them don't fall neatly into the 1.5 or 1.8 bracket. These are derivatives that get classed in their own areas."The first of these to branch off was the development of Touhoumon Essentials, commonly referred to as the Touhoumon DevKit, made by DerxwnaKapsyla, for the purpose of making Touhoumon Faith & Prayer Version. Both of these projects were done on RPG Maker XP."YThe Touhoumon DevKit was intended to allow people who utilize the Pokemon Essentials engine of RPG Maker XP to make their own Touhoumon game. Initially started in the 1.5 generation and seeing Version 1, the 1.5 version was scrapped and depreciated. It wasn't until 2 years later that Derxwna redid the DevKit, and rebranded it to 1.8 standards."Touhoumon Faith & Prayer Version was originally intended to be a 1.5 Generation fan-game, but pre-development influences changed it to the 1.8 Generation. Being a game not bound to any specific Pokemon game, it has its own plot, which is said to include Kanto, Johto, and Gensokyo."3Faith & Prayer version is also slated to have the ability to access the 493 Pokemon, from Bulbasaur to Arceus. It is, so far, the only Touhoumon game to have Non-Moeified Pokemon intrigrated into it as well. The Type Chart, which has more than 30 types on it now, is being modified to combine the two games."Touhoumon Gaiden is a game built on the RPG Maker XP engine, like Faith & Prayer version. However, this game was not built using the DevKit engine, and is instead its own self-contained project. It's developer, SoulfulLex, is basing it as a reinvisioning of the Gen 4 Johto remakes."…Gaiden is also straying from the 1.8 curve altogether and going for a more interesting gameplay environment, such as several new moves, new evolutions, and the decombination of Electric and Wind types."ÃGoing back to Rom Hacks, a more unusual game of its kind; Touhoumon Ordinary version. Not only is it a rom hack of the Generation 2 games, it's a rom hack of Pokemon Silver, which is virtually unheard of."˙Ordinary keeps the exact same plot as Vanilla Johto, just replacing the Pokemon with Touhoumon. Unfortunately, due to dex restrictions, several Touhoumon were cut from the listing, and nothing after Touhou 12, Undefined Fantastic Object, are present."ﬂBeing a Gen 2 game, it does not utilize the Physical/Special Split, and is based off a pseudo-1.5 Environment.

It was the introduction of several new concepts, and mechanics. The most noteable addition was the Diamond/Pearl Skill Split System, or more as it's called in English communities, the Physical/Special Split."Alongside the Physical/Special Split came a completely overhauled type chart, featuring several new types that weren't in Pokemon (Such as Faith, Dream, Illusion, Heart), and replacing some of the older types with the new ones (Like Dragon, Bug, Normal, and Fighting)."ΩThe 1.8 Generation also had a more streamlined evolution system. Unlike the previkous Touhoumon generations, where Touhoumon would evolve in 3 Stages (Chibi-Normal-EX), with some special evolutions, (Final, Advent, Last Word, this system had Touhoumon evolve from Chibi into several different forms. A vast majority of Puppets have Shard Evolutions, which evolve them into specialized forms, such as Attack Forms, Defense Forms, and Speed Forms."«There are other, more non-specific, stone roles, such as Helper Forms, Technical Forms, and Advent Forms. These roles cover a much different playstyle than the basic Attack, Defense, and Speed roles."Continue reading?"ÄDespite its massive changes - or maybe it's in spite of - Generation 1.8 has been the least hacked of the Touhoumon generations."ÖThough, the hacks that have been made on the 1.8 Engine are rather well known ones: Touhoumon Purple and Touhou Puppet Play Enhanced."5Touhoumon Purple, developed by Agastya, is a hack of Pokemon Emerald. It does not change the plot, but it does tweak the level curve to make the game just a bit more challenging for players. Unlike other Emerald-based hacks in general, Purple has a complete and functioning Battle Frontier and Contest system."Touhou Puppet Play Enhanced is developed by Aichiya Sanae, developer of the prolific 1.5 hacks, World Link and Another World. This hack was based off Fire Red, and as a result features Kanto. However, unlike most other common Touhoumon hacks, this one features Johto in the postgame."øGeneration 1.8 brought about the most change to the system, but had little in the room of development. To be expected, since this was the last official Touhoumon release by Hemo and his team."Niche Touhoumon Games"ÕTouhoumon has inspired other developers to make Touhoumon games of their own. However, some of them don't fall neatly into the 1.5 or 1.8 bracket. These are derivatives that get classed in their own areas."The first of these to branch off was the development of Touhoumon Essentials, commonly referred to as the Touhoumon DevKit, made by DerxwnaKapsyla, for the purpose of making Touhoumon Faith & Prayer Version. Both of these projects were done on RPG Maker XP."YThe Touhoumon DevKit was intended to allow people who utilize the Pokemon Essentials engine of RPG Maker XP to make their own Touhoumon game. Initially started in the 1.5 generation and seeing Version 1, the 1.5 version was scrapped and depreciated. It wasn't until 2 years later that Derxwna redid the DevKit, and rebranded it to 1.8 standards."Touhoumon Faith & Prayer Version was originally intended to be a 1.5 Generation fan-game, but pre-development influences changed it to the 1.8 Generation. Being a game not bound to any specific Pokemon game, it has its own plot, which is said to include Kanto, Johto, and Gensokyo."3Faith & Prayer version is also slated to have the ability to access the 493 Pokemon, from Bulbasaur to Arceus. It is, so far, the only Touhoumon game to have Non-Moeified Pokemon intrigrated into it as well. The Type Chart, which has more than 30 types on it now, is being modified to combine the two games."Touhoumon Gaiden is a game built on the RPG Maker XP engine, like Faith & Prayer version. However, this game was not built using the DevKit engine, and is instead its own self-contained project. It's developer, SoulfulLex, is basing it as a reinvisioning of the Gen 4 Johto remakes."…Gaiden is also straying from the 1.8 curve altogether and going for a more interesting gameplay environment, such as several new moves, new evolutions, and the decombination of Electric and Wind types."ÃGoing back to Rom Hacks, a more unusual game of its kind; Touhoumon Ordinary version. Not only is it a rom hack of the Generation 2 games, it's a rom hack of Pokemon Silver, which is virtually unheard of."˙Ordinary keeps the exact same plot as Vanilla Johto, just replacing the Pokemon with Touhoumon. Unfortunately, due to dex restrictions, several Touhoumon were cut from the listing, and nothing after Touhou 12, Undefined Fantastic Object, are present."ﬂBeing a Gen 2 game, it does not utilize the Physical/Special Split, and is based off a pseudo-1.5 Environment. That being said, Touhoumon Ordinary is more or less complete and available for download on the Skeetendo forums."…There are several other Rom Hacks which break the standard 1.5 and 1.8 formula, such as Touhoumon A+E, as well as Neotornado's Touhoumon game, even reports of a Touhoumon Diamond game are in the works."°It is very likely that the Touhoumon development trend will continue for quite a while, as it seems to be popular in both Eastern and Western Touhou communities."Introduction to Touhoumon"ÉTouhou Puppet Play, or Touhoumon, originally started as a Rom Hack for Pokemon Fire Red Version, specifically the Japanese version."PIt was made by HemoglobinA1C and his development team, now named FocasLens."xThere were three key generations to Touhoumon's life cycle: Generation 1.0~1.2, Generation 1.5, and Generation 1.8."UThose three generations introduced radical shifts to their playstyle and format."µNot enough information is known about Generation 1.0~1.2 to document it, however if you wish to know a bit more about Generations 1.5 and 1.8, please check the bookshelves in row 2."9What?

By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger."ãTo support its bulb, Ivysaur's legs grow sturdy. If it spends more time lying in the sunlight, the bud will soon bloom into a large flower."ëVenusaur's flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people."óThe flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is happy, and blazes when it is enraged."ùWithout pity, its sharp claws destroy foes. If it encounters a strong enemy, it becomes agitated, and the flame on its tail flares with a bluish white color."òA Charizard flies about in search of strong opponents. It breathes intense flames that can melt any material. However, it will never torch a weaker foe."ûIts shell is not just for protection. Its rounded shape and the grooves on its surface minimize resistance in water, enabling Squirtle to swim at high speeds."ûIts large tail is covered with rich, thick fur that deepens in color with age. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pok√©mon's toughness in battle."ñThe waterspouts that protrude from its shell are highly accurate. Their bullets of water can precisely nail tin cans from a distance of over 160 feet."èIts voracious appetite compels it to devour leaves bigger than itself without hesitation. It releases a terribly strong odor from its antennae."êIts shell is as hard as an iron slab. A Metapod does not move very much because it is preparing its soft innards for evolution inside the shell."ñIt has a superior ability to search for delicious honey from flowers. It can seek, extract, and carry honey from flowers blooming over six miles away."£A Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It distinguishes its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose)."¢It remains virtually immobile while it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it busily prepares for evolution. This is evident from how hot its shell becomes."áA Beedrill is extremely territorial. For safety reasons, no one should ever approach its nest. If angered, they will attack in a swarm."ñIt has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It can unerringly return home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings."§This Pok√©mon flies around, patrolling its large territory. If its living space is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws."òPidgeot has gorgeous, glossy feathers. Many trainers are so captivated by the beautiful feathers on its head that they choose Pidgeot as their Pok√©mon."ìA Rattata is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep, it constantly moves its ears and listens for danger. It will make its nest anywhere."áA Raticate's sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses."üIts loud cry can be heard over half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger."ãIts long neck and elongated beak are ideal for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves this extended and skinny beak to pluck prey."§An Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. This position allows it to quickly respond to an enemy from any direction with a threat from its upraised head."üThis Pok√©mon has a terrifically strong constricting power. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once it wraps its body around its foe, escaping is impossible."ñIt stores electricity in the electric sacs on its cheeks. When it releases pent-up energy in a burst, the electric power is equal to a lightning bolt."êIf it stores too much electricity, its behavior turns aggressive. To avoid this, it occasionally discharges excess energy and calms itself down."íWhen it curls up in a ball, it can make any attack bounce off harmlessly. Its hide has turned tough and solid as a result of living in the desert."ïIt curls up in a ball to protect itself from enemy attacks. It also curls up to prevent heatstroke during the daytime when temperatures rise sharply."úIts highly toxic barbs are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pok√©mon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn."éWhen it is with its friends or family, its barbs are tucked away to prevent injury. It appears to become nervous if separated from the others."îIt is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles using its tough, scaly body. This Pok√©mon is at its strongest when it is defending its young."ìThe male Nidoran has developed muscles that freely move its ears in any direction. Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pok√©mon's notice."üIts horn is harder than a diamond. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might."ûA Nidoking's thick tail packs enormously destructive power capable of toppling a metal transmission tower. Once it goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it."¢On every night of a full moon, they come out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired Clefairy go to sleep nestled up against each other in deep and quiet mountains."öA Clefable uses its wings to skip lightly as if it were flying. Its bouncy step lets it even walk on water. On quiet, moonlit nights, it strolls on lakes."ÜIt can freely control fire, making fiery orbs fly like will-o'-the-wisps. Just before evolution, its six tails grow hot as if on fire."àIt has long been said that each of the nine tails embody an enchanted power. A long-lived Ninetales will have fur that shines like gold."îNothing can avoid falling asleep hearing a Jigglypuff's song. The sound waves of its singing voice match the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep."ìIts fur is the ultimate in luxuriousness. Sleeping alongside a Wigglytuff is simply divine. Its body expands seemingly without end when it inhales."èWhile living in pitch-black caverns, their eyes gradually grew shut and deprived them of vision. They use ultrasonic waves to detect obstacles."úIts fangs easily puncture even thick animal hide. It loves to feast on the blood of people and Pok√©mon. It flits about in darkness and strikes from behind."óIt grows by absorbing moonlight. During the daytime, it buries itself in the ground, leaving only its leaves exposed to avoid detection by its enemies."üA horribly noxious honey drools from its mouth. One whiff of the honey can result in memory loss. Some fans are said to enjoy this overwhelming stink, however."ûIn seasons when it produces more pollen, the air around a Vileplume turns yellow with the powder as it walks. The pollen is highly toxic and causes paralysis."ôA Paras has parasitic tochukaso mushrooms growing on its back. They grow by drawing nutrients from the host. They are valued as a medicine for long life."òParasect are known to infest the roots of large trees en masse and drain nutrients. When an infested tree dies, they move onto another tree all at once."óIts coat of thin, stiff hair that covers its entire body is said to have evolved for protection. Its large eyes never fail to spot even miniscule prey."üVenomoth are nocturnal--they only are active at night. Their favorite prey are insects that gather around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness."åDiglett are raised in most farms. The reason is simple--wherever they burrow, the soil is left perfectly tilled for growing delicious crops."éBecause the triplets originally split from one body, they think exactly alike. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly through the ground."îMeowth withdraw their sharp claws into their paws to silently sneak about. For some reason, this Pok√©mon loves shiny coins that glitter with light."ÖA Persian's six bold whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in its vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed by the whiskers."öWhen its headache intensifies, it starts using strange powers. However, it has no recollection of its powers, so it always looks befuddled and bewildered."ëA Golduck is an adept swimmer. It sometimes joins competitive swimmers in training. It uses psychic powers when its forehead shimmers with light."óWhen it starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns rough, it's a sure sign of anger. However, since this happens instantly, there is no time to flee."ëWhen it becomes furious, its blood circulation becomes more robust, and its muscles are made stronger. But it also becomes much less intelligent."ôIts superb sense of smell ensures that this Pok√©mon won't forget any scent, no matter what. It uses its sense of smell to detect the emotions of others."ôThis fleet-footed Pok√©mon is said to run over 6,200 miles in a single day and night. The fire that blazes wildly within its body is its source of power."†It is possible to see this Pok√©mon's spiral innards right through its thin skin. However, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp fangs bounce right off it."¶Its body surface is always wet and slick with an oily fluid. Because of this greasy covering, it can easily slip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle."õIts highly developed muscles never grow fatigued, however much it exercises. This Pok√©mon can swim back and forth across the Pacific Ocean without effort."~A Pok√©mon that sleeps 18 hours a day. Observation revealed that it uses Teleport to change its location once every hour."ãIt is rumored that a boy with psychic abilities suddenly transformed into Kadabra while he was assisting research into extrasensory powers."âWhile it has strong psychic abilities and high intelligence, an Alakazam's muscles are very weak. It uses psychic power to move its body."óIt continually undertakes strenuous training to master all forms of martial arts. Its strength lets it easily hoist a sumo wrestler onto its shoulders."áA belt is worn by a Machoke to keep its overwhelming power under control. Because it is so dangerous, no one has ever removed the belt."éIt is impossible to defend against punches and chops doled out by its four arms. Its fighting spirit flares up when it faces a tough opponent."°A Bellsprout's thin and flexible body lets it bend and sway to avoid any attack, however strong it may be. From its mouth, it leaks a fluid that melts even iron."üAt night, a Weepinbell hangs on to a tree branch with its hooked rear and sleeps. If it moves around in its sleep, it may wake up to find itself on the ground."°The long vine extending from its head is waved about as if it were a living thing to attract prey. When an unsuspecting victim approaches, it is swallowed whole."íIts body is almost entirely composed of water. It ensnares its foe with its two long tentacles, then stabs with the poison stingers at their tips."íIt lives in complex rock formations on the ocean floor and traps prey using its 80 tentacles. Its red orbs glow when it grows excited or agitated."óIt climbs mountain paths using only the power of its arms. Because they look just like boulders lining paths, hikers may step on them without noticing."úThey descend from mountains by tumbling down steep slopes. They are so brutal, they smash aside obstructing trees and huge boulders with thunderous tackles."öIt is said to live in volcanic craters on mountain peaks. Once a year, it sheds its hide and grows larger. The shed hide crumbles and returns to the soil."íA Ponyta is very weak at birth. It can barely stand up. Its legs become stronger as it stumbles and falls while trying to keep up with its parent."ùIt usually canters casually in the fields and plains.
