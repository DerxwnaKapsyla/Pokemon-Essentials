Yitria Resurrection
Master Change Log

THIS CHANGE LOG DOCUMENTS EVERYTHING DONE TO THE GAME IN EVERY CAPACITY.
IF I HAVE LEFT THIS IN, IT IS AN ACCIDENT, BUT OTHERWISE FEEL FREE TO LOOK OVER MY WORK HABITS!

Tomorrow's mapping plans:

To be done Eventually:

- Get the script for footprints in the sand
- tweak the font used for "Yitria Resurrection" on the title screen
- maybe change the splash screen music again, idk
- change the graphic used on the continue screen (to what, idk yet)
- potentially tweak the intro scene again (mostly involving the oak segment. it could be made much prettier looking with enough effort.)
- Get proper graphics for EVERYBODY
- Work on the Surf/Good Rod/Super Rod encounters for Pharos City, Yozora Island, and Route 3
- Adjust the AI on Gym Leaders, Alyssia, and EB Commanders
- Fix the flight points for towns to rectify Teleport locations
- Rename "D" to Delta, rename "J" to Iota
- Work on revised Battle Transitions for the important NPCs
- Fill out the TM on Yozora Island
- Add in Liquid Revive
- Add in a theme for Trading

make sure observatry events updaer journal properly
also do something about text overflow in journal

- Revise the lore, bring down the time scale from 500 years to 50~100 (All Teleporter Relay NPCs need to be adjusted)
- Make sure ALL Teleporter Relays are set to use 4 badges instead of 5
- Add in some sort of sidequest that involves the variants of Floette and bringing them to the Graveyard Zone in PokeIsland Park, which will allow you to get Eternal Flower Floette
- Get the Battle Tent tiles and add them to a tileset; it'll serve as the tents for the Undersea Exploration Areas (Safari Zone replacement)

Add buildings of some kind to the sea routes between Central Yitria and Chusei City, and Kortalan City and Charamada Island. These houses act as spots where the player can descend into the Zirconial Ocean, and eventually find ruins that contain big loot, rare Pokemon, including potential Legendaries. Tie some sidequest chains to these areas. Alternatively or also, make it so it works like the Safari Zone and have the Scuba Gear you're wearing have a step/breath counter. When it runs to 0, add a notification that says "WARNING: Tank oxygen levels running low. The estimated oxygen levels remaining are just enough to return to the surface. Please return now." or something like that.


- The Ferry Captain will be held captive at the Weather Instute while the Enigma Brigade is there, which prevents the player from accessing the ferry that'll let them cross to Western Yitria. Once you rescue the captain, they will be grateful, tell the player they will be at their shack and if they need a trip to Western Yitria, they can hit them up.
