# Midbattle Scripts
#===============================================================================
# This module stores all custom battle scripts that can be called upon with the
# battle rule "midbattleScript" if you don't want to input the entire script in
# the event script itself, due to it being too long or if you just find it neater
# this way.
#
# Note that when calling one of the scripts here, you do so in the event by
# setting the constant you defined here as a battle rule.
#
# 	For example:  
#   setBattleRule("midbattleScript", :DEMO_SPEECH)
#
#   *Note that a semi-colon is required in front of the constant when called, 
#    but not when defined below.
