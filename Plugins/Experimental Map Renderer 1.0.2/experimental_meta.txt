# Notes
#=====================================================================
#
# This is an EXPERIMENTAL plugin. Do not expect it to work properly.
# Do not expect support.
#
# This plugin is a potential new map renderer for Essentials. It aims
# to fix any lag issues for people using AMD graphics cards, and also
# to be faster all round. It is in plugin form so that it can be
# tested quickly and easily - if it works properly, it will be
# included in Essentials v20.
#
# This map renderer should work properly with connected maps, map
# transfers (including diving), screen shifting while buying from a
# Mart, etc. The number of connected maps being shown at once should
# have no noticeable effect on its speed.
#
# You can now have each autotile animate at its own rate. The default
# is 5 (each frame of the animation lasts 5/20ths of a second), but
# you can put "[x]" at the end of the autotile's filename (where "x"
# is a number) and it will use that value instead, i.e. each frame of
# the animation will last x/20ths of a second.
#
# There is a little-known unused feature in RMXP known as flash_data.
# In fact, it is unusable since it cannot be edited in RMXP. It was
# intended to allow each tile of a map to flash its own colour when
# the screen flashes. This is currently unsupported, because it's
# impossible to set a map's flash_data with RMXP and because screen
# flashing works differently anyway. The code for it may well be
# removed.
#
# The map renderer has variables for ox, oy and visible. These are all
# currently unused, and I doubt anyone would ever use them, so they
# may well be removed.
