# I want to keep all of Prismriver Manor's specific scripts in one file so it is
# easier to find them. A detailed list of effects will be provided below.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the Challenge Mode for Prismriver Manor, there will be several effects
# that can occur within the mansion on different floors. There will be two
# types of effects. 
#
# The first one is Floor Effects, which will occur for every battle on that 
# floor. Things like blidness (lowers accuracy in every battle by 1), Phantom
# Weather (Rain, Sun, Hail, Sand), stuff like that.
#
# The second type is Random Effects, which occur during battle, but are only
# relevant for that battle specifically (except for in the case of Status
# conditions). These can range from the adjustment of stats, completely
# changing the ability of a battler, the application of effects such as
# Ingrain and Aurora Veil, the aforementioned status conditions, and more.
#
# Every floor will determine its Floor Effect upon the first time visiting
# it, and it will always be different every run. 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Floor Effects:
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Phantom Weather:
# * Will apply the effects of weather to all battles on that floor.
#
# Blindness:
# * Makes it so all Puppets have -1 Accuracy.
#
# Phantom Terrain:
# * Will apply Field Effects to all battles on that floor.
