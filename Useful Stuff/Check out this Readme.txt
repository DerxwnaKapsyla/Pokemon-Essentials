As such, if you downloaded this from a website not on this list, 
please consider redownloading so you can be sure you have everything. 
Also, please send me a message so I can inspect it myself.

If you downloaded it, please make sure you got it from one of the 
official websites listed above. It ensures you have the latest, 
up-to-date version, and cuts down on the chance of an outdated 
version being released. It also makes it easier for me to give you 
bug support help if you're using a current version.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
YR02. SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This game was created in RPG Maker XP, a computer program that allows 
you to create RPG-genre games on the computer, compatible for the 
Computer only. As such, Yitria Resurrection will NOT be compatible 
with any Game Boy Advance emulator, DS Emulator, or any Handheld 
emulator of the sort. Please do not ask me how to make it compatible 
with any emulator, there is no way to do so. 

On the same note, please do not ask me how to play it on an Android 
Phone/iPhone/Whatever smart phone you may possess. The same applies as
above, there is no way to play Yitria Resurrection on a Smartphone. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
YR03. IMPORTANT INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Please do not mess with the system files, they keep the game running 
stable. If you need something addressed, please send me a message so I
can help you. Contact information will be below. Furthermore, if you 
do mess with the system files of the game, or use memory editors to 
mess with the game, and you manage to break something, I am not 
responsible for what breaks. You brought it upon yourself, and the 
only advice you'll get from me is "Start a new game."

There are documents in the folder labeled "THIS IS USEFUL STUFF" which
provide information about certain subjects, including the a link to 
a google doc that contains a master list of certain things (such as
trainer levels)

Do not get too attached to your save file, and be prepared to ending 
up having to start a new game sometime as the game develops further. 
Some changes to the internal coding may render the game unplayable 
with your old save, and require a full restart. I will repeat this 
again: DO NOT GET ATTACHED TO YOUR SAVE FILE WHILE THE GAME IS IN 
PRE-FULL RELEASE STATE. I do not want people to come crying to me 
when their save breaks because of an update, when it's explicitly 
stated that an update could/will break your save.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
YR04. GAME INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yitria Resurrection is a Fangame that takes place within the Pokemon
universe. It plays like a standard game of the series, where you
control a protagonist character and go on a journey to become the
best trainer in the region. The story is about on par with an official
game, if a tad bit closer to the heavier side, but isn't overbearing.
The game utilizes mechanics pulled from the 6th Generation currently
(with mechanics from the 7th Generation in planning!). 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
YR05. DEFAULT CONTROLS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

in game.

	* Movement across the Overworld
	* Scrolls the cursor within menus

C Button/Enter Button

X Button/Escape Button

YR06. BUGS AND UNFINISHED THINGS IN THE CURRENT RELEASE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
EVERYTHING IS SHITCODE I AM A TERRIBLE PROGRAMMER! :wackospin:

The game may lag on some older machines, due to how much information 
the game has to process from the internal scripts. Aside from that, 
there are no other bugs I am aware of currently. 

It should go without saying, but the area on Pharos City's beach is
incomplete in this build, and won't be finished until the end of the
game. There will be a code to bypass the entire sidequest chain, and
it is already in the game, but if you use it you'll get nothing out
of it, and you'll still be unable to use that area until it becomes
properly accessible.

On that note, the codes for the other goodies are also in the game,
but almost all of them are non-functional at the current point in
time. 

Yes, I am aware that a lot of graphics are placeholders. I'm looking
into getting the important graphics (Gym leaders/Protagonist/etc.)
done first. If you would like to volunteer for this position, please
contact me at your leisure.

There may be some weird bugs as a result of engine upgrading. If you 
come across anything, please do not hesitate to report it to me.
