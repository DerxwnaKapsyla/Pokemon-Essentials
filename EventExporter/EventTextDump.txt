 @>Text: There are seven in total.

  :    : Attack forms.

 @>Text: And finally, Chrome Shards, which evolve Puppets 
  :    : into special one-off forms.
 @>Text: Power, Defense, and Swift Shards are simple 
  :    : enough to deduce what they do. They prioritize 
  :    : Attack, Defense, and Speed.
 @>Text: The rest are not as straightforward.
 @>Text: Support Shards make Puppets more attuned for 
  :    : supportive roles. They can be good for other 
  :    : purposes, but are best suited at support.
 @>Text: Technical forms are... complicated. There is no clear 
  :    : way to explain what they do, aside from 
  :    : redistributing a Puppet's natural abilities.
 @>Text: Advent Forms are also interesting, in that there's no 
  :    : clear way to define what they do as well.
 @>Text: They're like Tech forms, except they give Puppets the 
  :    : Advent ability, which makes them immune to 
  :    : secondary effects.
 @>Text: Chrome Shards are peculiar. There's no rhyme or 
  :    : reason to what they evolve, or why their forms are 
  :    : dependant on it.
 @>Text: Advent and Chrome Shards have the least amount of 
  :    : evolutions, so be aware of what Puppets evolve 
  :    : from those before purchasing any.
 @>Text: \b(There should be a text file included with the game

 :    : most likely Grilled Lamprey.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Grilled Lamprey? Doesn't that have supposed health

@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Yes, actually. Curious that you should bring that up,
 :    : since it might be relevant to us right now.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Supposedly, grilling up lamprey has the effect of improving
 :    : eyesight when eaten. I say supposedly, but this isn't something that's
 :    : been documented in great detail.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]If you can find some of the Grilled Lamprey on this
 :    : floor, you may be able to restore your vision.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]But, I don't think it'll last for too long... This darkness is
 :    : abnormally thick, almost like a fog.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Chances are, once the lamprey fully digests, you'll have
 :    : difficulty seeing again.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]I wish I could give you an accurate estimate of how long
 :    : before it'll wear off... But I can't imagine it lasting longer than seven
 :    : battles at the most.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]That... really isn't a lot of time, not when you factor in 
 :    : wild Puppets.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Correct. I would also guess that you can't consume
 :    : more than one dish at a time. You would need to wait for
 :    : the first one to wear off before being able to eat more.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]If that's true, whoever caused this darkness must really
 :    : have it out for us.

@>Text: \xn[Stone #5]ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS WALK UP TO ONE OF THE

 @>Text: \xn[Lyrica]Oh right! Weren't there statues coming to life

 @>Wait: 30 frame(s)
 @>Text: \xn[Lunasa]Actually, we do have one last thing to ask of you.
 @>Text: \xn[Lunasa]Earlier this evening, there were odd disturbances around
  :    : the mansion.
 @>Text: \xn[Lyrica]Oh right! Weren't there statues coming to life
  :    : and actual poltergeists making the walls bloody?
 @>Text: \xn[\pn]Wait, does that mean this is a haunted mansion?
 @>Text: \xn[Lunasa]This stuff has never happened before is the thing!
 @>Text: \xn[Lunasa]Sure, we've gone invisible and made various things
  :    : float, but this is a bit excessive even by our standards.
 @>Text: \xn[Merlin]We decided to get Mystia to help, since
  :    : she was already here and we were on break,
  :    : but...
 @>Text: \xn[\pn]Right, I remember her mentioning something about
  :    : a disturbance earlier... Right before she accused me
  :    : and my friends of being the source.
 @>Text: \xn[Lunasa]We're so busy practicing right now that we
  :    : just don't have the time to look into it, but it's becoming
  :    : troublesome.
 @>Text: \xn[Lyrica]We scoured the mansion as best we could, but
  :    : there was nobody hiding on any of the floors.
 @>Text: \xn[Merlin]There's only one place we haven't looked...
 @>Text: \xn[Lunasa]And that would be the basement. We seldom have
  :    : a reason to really go down there, so sometimes we just
  :    : forget it exists.
 @>Text: \xn[\pn]...You forget an entire floor of your mansion
  :    : exists?
 @>Wait: 20 frame(s)
 @>Text: \xn[\pn]So lemme just get this straight. You want me
  :    : to head down to the basement and investigate it,

 @>Text: \xn[Lyrica]Pretty much! I'm sure that someone of
  :    : your skills will be more than qualified to handle
  :    : whatever's down there~.
 @>Text: \xn[\pn]You give me too much credit, but... I guess
  :    : we have some time to spare, I wouldn't mind going
  :    : down to check.
 @>Text: \xn[\pn]How do I get down to the basement anyway? Is there
  :    : an entrance outside, or...?
 @>Text: \xn[Lyrica]Nah~ Back on the first floor near the stairs leading up,
  :    : there's a door that leads into a room with stairs going down.
 @>Text: \xn[Lyrica]Down those stairs is the basement, a very dark and
  :    : dusty place.
 @>Text: \xn[Lyrica]We usually keep the door to it locked up tight so
  :    : nobody can get in, but since you're heading down
  :    : there I'll just head down and wait for you there.

@>Text: \xn[Kota]Well, don't worry about it! As long as you're here
 :    : we can begin our activities!
@>Text: \xn[\pn]So, what exactly did we all have planned to do?
@>Text: \xn[Maya]I'm helping out at the Kirisame General Store while
 :    : Mr. Kirisame is taking his break, but that won't be for a while
 :    : yet.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]I'll be at Ms. Keine's Quiz Hall. I feel like testing my 
 :    : knowledge and seeing if my history lessons have paid off.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]There isn't much that's open on the first day that I'm 
 :    : interested in, so I might just bounce between stalls for today.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]I'm interested in checking out the Village Tournament, 
 :    : but that being said, I think there's one thing everyone has 
 :    : their eye on...
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]You mean Miss Minoriko's stand, don't you?
@>Text: \xn[Kota]I did hear that she was going to be selling homemade
 :    : Youkai Mountain delacacies.
@>Text: \xn[Maya]I'm more interested in the lottery she's holding,
 :    : and the prospect of a "special reward".
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]That does seem to be the talk of the festival. Currently,
 :    : it doesn't seem as if anybody has managed to claim this reward.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]It also doesn't seem this is an exclusive reward,
 :    : so it seems like multiple people will be able to win...
 :    : whatever it is.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]It's basically been the talk of the festival. Though, Miss
 :    : Minoriko claims it isn't some elaborate prize, it'll still be a very
 :    : worthwhile one.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]I'd be interested in checking it out later when we're
 :    : all available to, as it doesn't seem like she's finished setting up
 :    : the stall right now.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]I wouldn't be opposed to it either.
@>Text: \xn[Maya]Nor would I! So, I nominate \pn to come and find us
 :    : once she's ready!
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Wait, why me!
@>Text: \xn[Maya]If you're going to be participating in the Tournament,
 :    : we can't very well just pull you out of it, you know?
@>Text: \xn[Kota]Short of Maya helping out at Mr. Kirisame's shop,
 :    : all of our activities can kinda be dropped at a moment's
 :    : notice.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]I... suppose that makes sense, yeah I can get
 :    : behind that logic.
@>Text: \xn[Maya]So, let's recap then where we'll be so \pn remembers
 :    : where to find us!
@>Text: \xn[Maya]I'll be loitering around here, provided I'm not helping out
 :    : at Mr. Kirisame's shop.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]I'll probably be loitering around here as well, or over
 :    : at one of the various stands.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]I will be at Miss Keine's Quiz Hall for most of the
 :    : day.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Alright... I think I got it. I'll come get you guys once I'm ready then!

@>Text: \xn[Maya]Alright, so as we can all see, Miss Minoriko's
 :    : stand is finally open.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Any clue what she's actually selling there?
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]No idea, but whatever it is it smells delicious!
@>Text: \xn[Kota]I was here while she was setting it up, it looks like
 :    : its a bunch of Mountain-made delacacies.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]Most notably, it appears the main focus of the stand is
 :    : the freshly made jam. It seems the Human-friendly tribes got
 :    : together to make a bunch of jam for the festival.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]That would definitely explain the scent!
@>Text: \xn[Maya]Anything else you can tell us, Kota?
@>Text: \xn[Kota]It seems that with every purchase, you can draw from a 
 :    : lottery, which'll get you other Mountain-made delicacies.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Surely that isn't all. I heard something about a special 
 :    : prize, afterall.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]I was getting to that!
@>Text: \xn[Kota]Ahem, apparently, it seems as if there's a special
 :    : prize that any specific customer person can only win once.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]Apparently, the special prize is a battle against
 :    : Miss Minoriko herself. 
@>Show Animation: Player, [Exclaim bubble]
@>Text: \xn[\pn]A battle you say?
@>Text: \xn[Maya]Oh dear, looks like \pn is having thoughts again!
@>Text: \xn[\pn]What!? Can you really blame me if I like battling!
@>Text: \xn[Kota]Well, don't get your hopes up too high. So far, nobody
 :    : has managed to win that prize.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]Her stand has been seeing people constantly lining up
 :    : for it since it opened, and not a single customer has won yet.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]And this isn't some one-time grand prize, right?
 :    : Anybody can win it so long as they haven't won it yet?
@>Text: \xn[Kota]Precisely. Though, knowing \pn's luck, she'll probably
 :    : win it on her first purchase.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]I hate that I can't say you're wrong, even if I wouldn't 
 :    : mind...
@>Text: \xn[Maya]Well, even if we don't win it, I assume we could still
 :    : relegate the prize in her direction, yes?
@>Text: \xn[Maya]That would account for if someone purchased a jar,
 :    : but weren't actually Puppet handlers.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]Yep! More precisely, the winner can choose if
 :    : they want to battle Miss Minoriko, or if they want to give
 :    : the battle to someone else.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]This gets around the issue of a return customer
 :    : getting the prize a second time.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]And since \pn is the one with the most battle
 :    : experience of us all here, and would most enjoy it, I see
 :    : no issues with giving it to her.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]I'm in agreement!

@>Text: \xn[Keine]According to this letter we recieved, at least. Though,
 :    : I see little else to explain our crops suddenly withering and
 :    : becoming inedible.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]That would line up with the aura of misfortune I felt
 :    : upon entering the Village, and further supports my theory.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Would you care to elaborate?
@>Text: \xn[Hina]It's really quite simple! The Village being cursed is
 :    : what links together the fairies and spirits being more
 :    : aggressive than usual.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]However, normally, a curse would only affect its
 :    : specific target.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]For it to rebound and affect areas outside of the 
 :    : Village, that would imply that the person who laid the curse 
 :    : has no experience with curses.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]It's something I'm quite accustomed to seeing, an
 :    : inexperienced individual casting a curse and having it rebound
 :    : in horrific, unexpected ways.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]We're lucky that this curse doesn't seem to have
 :    : rebounded in any sort of malignant way... At least, not that
 :    : we know of.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]I suppose that is a silver lining of sorts...
@>Text: \xn[Keine]So, do you have a solution in mind?
@>Text: \xn[Hina]Well, first I'll need to examine the Village more to find
 :    : the focal point of the curse. From there, I can begin dismantling 
 :    : it.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]As for the fairies, if they are indeed aflicted the same 
 :    : way as the spirits in the Forest are, simply defeating them in 
 :    : battle should get them to calm down... if only temporarily.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]I can help deal with the fairies, it shouldn't be that hard 
 :    : of a task.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Is there somewhere in specific I should go?
@>Text: \xn[Keine]There is, actually!
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Directly east of the Festival Grounds is where a
 :    : rather large congregation of Fairies have been spotted.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Taking care of them will go a long way in preventing
 :    : more from swooping into the village.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]While that's going on, I will go on patrol with
 :    : Miss Kagiyama and try to find where the curse is at its
 :    : strongest in the Village.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Directly east of the Village, so the farmlands and
 :    : Village Outskirts... Alright, shouldn't be a problem.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]I shall return to scouring the Chronicle,
 :    : I've managed to work through a fair number of
 :    : potential threats and ruled them out.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]We all have our tasks, then. Let's get to work,

@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]Since her birth, she's had poor relation with Humans

@>Text: \xn[Hina]This reinforces my theory, though! Given that it

@>Text: \xn[Hina]Especially once she realizes that the curse has
 :    : been taken down.
@>Text: \xn[Minoriko]While it is possible she may try to curse the Village

@>Text: \xn[Keine]I had proposed setting up defenses along the border

@>Text: \xn[Hina]However, if Medicine has a way to plant curses on
 :    : the Village, then it's possible she can take down those defenses

@>Text: \xn[Keine]Then what options do we have at our disposal? Surely
 :    : you aren't suggesting we sit back and allow her to take over the

@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]No, but we don't need it to be permanently.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]Right now she is akin to a child throwing a tantrum.

@>Text: \xn[\pn]Well, that settles my only worry. I guess my next

@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]You can usually reach the Nameless Hill by going
 :    : east of the Forest of Magic and heading north at the
 :    : crossroads leading to the Sanzu River.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]However, I suspect that Medicine will be expecting
 :    : some sort of retalliation. It's likely that some sort of barrier or
 :    : defensive line has been set up along that path.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]There is a second path, but it requires taking a less
 :    : direct route via the Misty Lake.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]It's not likely that Medicine will have accounted
 :    : for someone crossing the river to go all the way around.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]So, I just gotta ask Nitori for a ferry ride across the

 @>Text: \xn[Merlin]Essentially, your Puppets will be aflicted with status
  :    : conditions, which'll make battling much more difficult.
 @>Text: \xn[Merlin]Or, you might get unlucky and the enemy Puppet
  :    : is much stronger than usual!
 @>Text: \xn[Merlin]Though, perhaps you could get lucky and the

 @>Text: And finally, Chrome Shards, which evolve Puppets 
  :    : into special one-off forms.
 @>Text: Power, Defense, and Swift Shards are simple 
  :    : enough to deduce what they do. They prioritize 
  :    : Attack, Defense, and Speed.
 @>Text: The rest are not as straightforward.
 @>Text: Support Shards make Puppets more attuned for 
  :    : supportive roles. They can be good for other 
  :    : purposes, but are best suited at support.
 @>Text: Technical forms are... complicated. There is no clear 
  :    : way to explain what they do, aside from 
  :    : redistributing a Puppet's natural abilities.
 @>Text: Advent Forms are also interesting, in that there's no 
  :    : clear way to define what they do as well.
 @>Text: They're like Tech forms, except they give Puppets the 
  :    : Advent ability, which makes them immune to 
  :    : secondary effects.
 @>Text: Chrome Shards are peculiar. There's no rhyme or 
  :    : reason to what they evolve, or why their forms are 
  :    : dependant on it.
 @>Text: Advent and Chrome Shards have the least amount of 
  :    : evolutions, so be aware of what Puppets evolve 
  :    : from those before purchasing any.
 @>Text: \b(There should be a text file included with the game 
  :    : that documents Shard Evolutions. Consult that list for

 @>Text: \xn[\pn]Medicine... Just because you have a certain power

 @>Text: \xn[\pn]The same could be said of us Humans who use 
  :    : Puppets as well.
 @>Text: \xn[\pn]Sure, there are some of my kind that are malicious

 @>Text: \xn[\pn]And perhaps you might have even been able to

 @>Text: \xn[\pn]But, we were evenly matched. Not just in strength,

 @>Text: \xn[\pn]Even without you giving your Puppets a boost via

 @>Text: \xn[\pn]No! No Human is going to want to subjugate or control
  :    : you!
 @>Text: \xn[\pn]All I'm saying is to consider that the malicious Humans 
  :    : you've seen and experienced are a very small group.
 @>Text: \xn[\pn]At the very least, if you can't trust in Humans as a
  :    : whole to be kind and compasionate, put your trust in me.
 @>Text: \xn[\pn]Sure, I'm just some random nobody from the Village,

@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Tell me, \pn. You know why I called you here today,
 :    : correct?
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Well, if memory serves correctly, the letter said that you
 :    : wished to battle me.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Precisely. You see, \pn, I've heard about you and 
 :    : your talents.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]It's not very often that one can just brave the
 :    : curse-filled domain of the Great Youkai Forest, or the
 :    : miasma-laden Suzuran Field and walk away unscathed.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Especially when one is dealing with a fledgling Youkai
 :    : such as Medicine.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Not to mention, of course, being able to convince her 
 :    : to stand down. You must truly be something else to tackle all
 :    : of that!
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Thanks, I guess! I just did what had to be do-\.. Wait 
 :    : a second.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]How did you know about my battle with Medicine?
@>Text: \xn[\pn]I didn't include that in my interview with the Tengu 
 :    : reporter, and Miss Keine instructed me to keep that under 
 :    : wraps until further notice.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]When one lives so close to the home of the person
 :    : who was plotting to curse and overrun the Village, one tends to
 :    : overhear many interesting things.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Wait, so you knew all along that Medicine was behind
 :    : the incident in the Village?
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Well of course I did! It made for quite the interesting
 :    : series of events.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]So... If you knew, how come you didn't mention it to 
 :    : anyone in the Village?
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Well that's really quite simple to answer.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]You see, the affairs of what happens in the Human 
 :    : Village mean very little to me.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]I couldn't care less what happens to them, be it good 
 :    : or bad.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]I could go to bed one evening with the Village 
 :    : perfectly safe, then wake up the next and overhear that it's 
 :    : been destroyed by some malevolent Youkai.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]And it wouldn't mean a thing to me.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]...I... That's...
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Oh, come now! Did you forget? I'm a Youkai! We
 :    : are Humanity's greatest predator.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Sure, I might not lift a finger to harm the Village, but 
 :    : that doesn't mean I'll lift a finger to <i>protect</i> it, either.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Well, not unless something about what's befalling it 
 :    : interests me personally, of course.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]\b(Yep! Okay! She's every bit as terrifying as the stories
 :    : make her out to be! I don't even know what to say here!)
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Getting back to the original topic...

 :    : thought, too! Elder Youkai really are something else entirely...)
@>Fade Out BGM: 15 sec.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]You see, \pn. After hearing all of these stories about
 :    : you, I am very interested in what you can do.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]In... what I can do? I'm just a simple Human, what 
 :    : <i>can</i> I do that has you so interested in me?
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]I've seen many a trainer in the outside world with
 :    : command over Puppets, exceptional command over them.
 :    : Much like you, even.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]These individuals have toppled organisations left and
 :    : right with their mastery over Puppets.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Of course, I try not to interact with the Outside World 
 :    : too much. Gensokyo and the Outside World were separated for a
 :    : reason, afterall!
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]And it wouldn't do for a Youkai like me to suddenly
 :    : start terrorizing the Humans beyond the barrier.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]This has left me yearning for a chance to test my
 :    : skills against a trainer of equal calibur here in Gensokyo.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]And, to my surprise, I wouldn't have to wait too long!
@>Text: \xn[\pn]You mean me, of course. But am I really that strong?
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Oh make no mistake, \pn. You are absolutely one
 :    : of the strongest trainers in Gensokyo right now.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]...At least, among the ordinary folk. Which is what

@>Text: \xn[\pn]You mean the one about Puppets suddenly vanishing from 
 :    : the realm? I feel like that's a widespread rumor at this point.
@>Text: \xn[Daichi]Right, of course! So, in your expert opinion-
@>Text: \xn[\pn]My "expert opinion"?
@>Text: \xn[Daichi]Ever since the Harvest Festival incident, you've had your

@>Text: \xn[Daichi]I mean no disrespect if my words offended you, oh
 :    : Honored one.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]No, no, it's just... I wouldn't call myself an expert. I just happen
 :    : to be in the wrong place at the right time.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Presumably you want to know if I have any thoughts about
 :    : where the Puppets could be going.
@>Text: \xn[Daichi]If you have any thoughts on it, of course.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Hmm... Well, my first guess is that they're spilling into the
 :    : Outside World again, but we've been reassured that shouldn't
 :    : happen again after that gang's invasion.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Otherwise... Maybe they're returning to nature?
@>Text: \xn[Daichi]A bit morbid, wouldn't you think?
@>Text: \xn[\pn]You wanted my "expert" opinion! This is all I've got!
@>Text: \xn[Daichi]Hmm, let's go for a different angle then...
@>Text: \xn[Daichi]Do you think it's possible that they're being abducted?
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Abducted? Who would even do that? Who even has
 :    : the power to do that!
@>Text: \xn[Daichi]I have a few suspects in mind, but nothing

@>Text: \xn[\pn]Well, if I hear anything else, I'll be sure to let you know.

 :       : against the invasion, and is warned to avoid the Hell Fairies

@>Comment: 
 :       : The player then has to navigate through the Capital to
 :       : reach the Command Center, being careful to avoid

 :       : sent back to the storehouse.
@>Comment: 
 :       : Items will be scattered all over the map for the player to find,
 :       : but they will be guarded fairies. The player can return after

   @>Text: \xn[Sagume]Quite the opposite. In response to the abnormal

    :    : throughout Gensokyo to resolve conflicts, we opted to import
    :    : Puppets to counter the invaders.

    :    : the Gensokyo Capital Relocation Plan. But now..
   @>Text: \xn[\pn]Now..?
   @>Text: \xn[Sagume]Having spoken it aloud, that plan is now moot. Instead,

 :    : of Touhoumon Generation 1.8?
@>Show Choices: Touhou Series, Touhoumon 1.8, No thanks
(When Cancel: Choice 3)
: When [Touhou Series]
 @>Text: Touhou Project is a doujin series produced by ZUN of Team
  :    : Shanghai Alice. The official games are traditionally of the 
  :    : 2D-style shoot-em-up genre, with the occasional break for
  :    : fighting games.
 @>Text: There is also an amalgamate of print works and Music CDs 
  :    : that are officially released by Team Shanghai Alice.
 @>Text: The setting is Gensokyo, a haunted region of Japan, that houses 
  :    : Humans, Youkai, Gods, and other supernatural and  mythical
  :    : entities.
 @>Text: The plot of these games is self contained, usually not
  :    : connecting to future or past games aside from one-off
  :    : references, unless otherwise part of an arc.
 @>Text: As such, there is no definitive "order" to playing the games.
 @>Text: They usually revolve around the protagonists, Reimu Hakurei
  :    : and Marisa Kirisame, traveling through 6 normal stages, 
  :    : attempting to resolve the current incident of the game.
 @>Text: Incidents such as the Scarlet Mist incident, the Divine Spirits 
  :    : incident, the Urban Legend incident, and the Second Genso-Lunar
  :    : War, just to name a few.

: When [Touhoumon 1.8]
 @>Text: Touhoumon Generation 1.8 was a radical shift in the Touhoumon department.
  :    : It was the introduction of several new concepts, and mechanics. The
  :    : most notable addition was the Diamond/Pearl Skill Split System, or
  :    : as it's called in English communities, the Physical/Special Split.
 @>Text: Alongside the Physical/Special Split came a completely overhauled 
  :    : type chart, featuring several new types that weren't in Pokemon 
  :    : (Such as Faith, Dream, Illusion, Heart), and replacing some of the 
  :    : older types with the new ones (Like Dragon, Bug, Normal, and Fighting).
 @>Text: The 1.8 Generation also had a more streamlined evolution system. Unlike 
  :    : the previous Touhoumon generations, where Touhoumon would evolve in 3 Stages 
  :    : (Chibi-Normal-EX), with some special evolutions, (Final, Advent, Last Word, this 
  :    : system had Touhoumon evolve from Chibi into several different forms.
 @>Text: A vast majority of Puppets have Shard Evolutions, which evolve them 
  :    : into specialized forms, such as Attack Forms, Defense Forms, and Speed Forms.
 @>Text: There are other, more non-specific, stone roles, such as  Helper Forms, 
  :    : Technical Forms, and Advent Forms. These roles cover a much different 
  :    : playstyle than the basic Attack, Defense, and Speed roles.
 @>Text: Provided with the game is a Type Chart in the traditional and 
  :    : streamlined format, both present in the Useful Stuff folder, as
  :    : well as an explanation file for how to rationalize the type chart,
  :    : made by DoesntKnowHowToPlay.
