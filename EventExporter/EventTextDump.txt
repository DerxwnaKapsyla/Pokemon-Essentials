@>Text: \xn[Maya]Right, as I was saying just before you

@>Text: \xn[Maya]According to my information, this should be the 
 :    : Forest of Magic, which is directly south of the

@>Text: \xn[Maya]Presumably, the mansion we're looking for is in here.

 :    : south?
@>Text: \xn[Kota]I know I remember there being a branch in the road 
 :    : back between here and the village.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]I suppose it is a possibility. We were running 
 :    : so fast from the village that we didn't stop to check 
 :    : any other paths.
@>Text: \xn[Maya]No way! The mansion has to be in this forest, it's the 
 :    : perfect place for it!
@>Text: \xn[Maya]An abandoned mansion, deep within haunted

 @>Text: Shards are like stones that can be used to bring out a 
  :    : Puppet's potential.
 @>Text: The process is very similar to if you let a Puppet 
  :    : reach its natural evolution level.
 @>Text: There are seven in total.
 @>Text: Power Shards, which evolve Puppets into their 
  :    : Attack forms.
 @>Text: Defense Shards, which evolve Puppets into their 
  :    : Defense forms.

 @>Text: Solar Shards, which evolve Puppets into their Advent 
  :    : forms.
 @>Text: And finally, Chrome Shards, which evolve Puppets 
  :    : into special one-off forms.
 @>Text: Power, Defense, and Swift Shards are simple 
  :    : enough to deduce what they do. They prioritize 
  :    : Attack, Defense, and Speed.
 @>Text: The rest are not as straightforward.
 @>Text: Support Shards make Puppets more attuned for 
  :    : supportive roles. They can be good for other 
  :    : purposes, but are best suited at support.
 @>Text: Technical forms are... complicated. There is no clear 
  :    : way to explain what they do, aside from 
  :    : redistributing a Puppet's natural abilities.
 @>Text: Advent Forms are also interesting, in that there's no 
  :    : clear way to define what they do as well.
 @>Text: They're like Tech forms, except they give Puppets the 
  :    : Advent ability, which makes them immune to 
  :    : secondary effects.
 @>Text: Chrome Shards are peculiar. There's no rhyme or 
  :    : reason to what they evolve, or why their forms are 
  :    : dependant on it.
 @>Text: Advent and Chrome Shards have the least amount of 
  :    : evolutions, so be aware of what Puppets evolve 
  :    : from those before purchasing any.
 @>Text: \b(There should be a text file included with the game 
  :    : that documents Shard Evolutions. Consult that list for 
  :    : more information).

@>Text: \xn[\pn]Hey Shinji, you said you could smell fish on this 
 :    : floor?
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Precisely. Judging by the peculiar smell, I'd say it's 
 :    : most likely Grilled Lamprey.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Grilled Lamprey? Doesn't that have supposed health
 :    : benefits?
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Yes, actually. Curious that you should bring that up,
 :    : since it might be relevant to us right now.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Supposedly, grilling up lamprey has the effect of improving
 :    : eyesight when eaten. I say supposedly, but this isn't something that's
 :    : been documented in great detail.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]If you can find some of the Grilled Lamprey on this
 :    : floor, you may be able to restore your vision.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]But, I don't think it'll last for too long... This darkness is
 :    : abnormally thick, almost like a fog.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Chances are, once the lamprey fully digests, you'll have
 :    : difficulty seeing again.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]I wish I could give you an accurate estimate of how long
 :    : before it'll wear off... But I can't imagine it lasting longer than seven
 :    : battles at the most.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]That... really isn't a lot of time, not when you factor in 
 :    : wild Puppets.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Correct. I would also guess that you can't consume
 :    : more than one dish at a time. You would need to wait for
 :    : the first one to wear off before being able to eat more.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]If that's true, whoever caused this darkness must really
 :    : have it out for us.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Keep yourself sharp, \pn. In the darkness, you
 :    : never know what is waiting to strike.

@>Text: \l[3]Would you like a basic overview of the Touhou Project series, or 
 :    : of Touhoumon Generation 1.8?
@>Show Choices: Touhou Series, Touhoumon 1.8, No thanks
(When Cancel: Choice 3)
: When [Touhou Series]
 @>Text: Touhou Project is a doujin series produced by ZUN of Team
  :    : Shanghai Alice. The official games are traditionally of the 
  :    : 2D-style shoot-em-up genre, with the occasional break for
  :    : fighting games.
 @>Text: There is also an amalgamate of print works and Music CDs 
  :    : that are officially released by Team Shanghai Alice.
 @>Text: The setting is Gensokyo, a haunted region of Japan, that houses 
  :    : Humans, Youkai, Gods, and other supernatural and  mythical
  :    : entities.
 @>Text: The plot of these games is self contained, usually not
  :    : connecting to future or past games aside from one-off
  :    : references, unless otherwise part of an arc.
 @>Text: As such, there is no definitive "order" to playing the games.
 @>Text: They usually revolve around the protagonists, Reimu Hakurei
  :    : and Marisa Kirisame, traveling through 6 normal stages, 
  :    : attempting to resolve the current incident of the game.
 @>Text: Incidents such as the Scarlet Mist incident, the Divine Spirits 
  :    : incident, the Urban Legend incident, and the Second Genso-Lunar
  :    : War, just to name a few.

: When [Touhoumon 1.8]
 @>Text: Touhoumon Generation 1.8 was a radical shift in the Touhoumon department.
  :    : It was the introduction of several new concepts, and mechanics. The
  :    : most notable addition was the Diamond/Pearl Skill Split System, or
  :    : as it's called in English communities, the Physical/Special Split.
 @>Text: Alongside the Physical/Special Split came a completely overhauled 
  :    : type chart, featuring several new types that weren't in Pokemon 
  :    : (Such as Faith, Dream, Illusion, Heart), and replacing some of the 
  :    : older types with the new ones (Like Dragon, Bug, Normal, and Fighting).
 @>Text: The 1.8 Generation also had a more streamlined evolution system. Unlike 
  :    : the previous Touhoumon generations, where Touhoumon would evolve in 3 Stages 
  :    : (Chibi-Normal-EX), with some special evolutions, (Final, Advent, Last Word, this 
  :    : system had Touhoumon evolve from Chibi into several different forms.
 @>Text: A vast majority of Puppets have Shard Evolutions, which evolve them 
  :    : into specialized forms, such as Attack Forms, Defense Forms, and Speed Forms.
 @>Text: There are other, more non-specific, stone roles, such as  Helper Forms, 
  :    : Technical Forms, and Advent Forms. These roles cover a much different 
  :    : playstyle than the basic Attack, Defense, and Speed roles.
 @>Text: Provided with the game is a Type Chart in the traditional and 
  :    : streamlined format, both present in the Useful Stuff folder, as
  :    : well as an explanation file for how to rationalize the type chart,
  :    : made by DoesntKnowHowToPlay.
 @>Text: If you would like to learn more about Touhoumon, be it the 1.5 or
  :    : 1.8 Generations, the fangame scene, the sequel (Gensou Ningyou
  :    : Enbu), or any other aspect, you can visit the English Forums at
