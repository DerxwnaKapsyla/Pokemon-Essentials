 @>Text: There are seven in total.

  :    : Attack forms.

  :    : Defense forms.

  :    : forms.
 @>Text: And finally, Chrome Shards, which evolve Puppets 
  :    : into special one-off forms.
 @>Text: Power, Defense, and Swift Shards are simple 
  :    : enough to deduce what they do. They prioritize 
  :    : Attack, Defense, and Speed.
 @>Text: The rest are not as straightforward.
 @>Text: Support Shards make Puppets more attuned for 
  :    : supportive roles. They can be good for other 
  :    : purposes, but are best suited at support.
 @>Text: Technical forms are... complicated. There is no clear 
  :    : way to explain what they do, aside from 
  :    : redistributing a Puppet's natural abilities.
 @>Text: Advent Forms are also interesting, in that there's no 
  :    : clear way to define what they do as well.
 @>Text: They're like Tech forms, except they give Puppets the 
  :    : Advent ability, which makes them immune to 
  :    : secondary effects.
 @>Text: Chrome Shards are peculiar. There's no rhyme or 
  :    : reason to what they evolve, or why their forms are 
  :    : dependant on it.
 @>Text: Advent and Chrome Shards have the least amount of 
  :    : evolutions, so be aware of what Puppets evolve 
  :    : from those before purchasing any.
 @>Text: \b(There should be a text file included with the game

 :    : most likely Grilled Lamprey.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Grilled Lamprey? Doesn't that have supposed health
 :    : benefits?
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Yes, actually. Curious that you should bring that up,
 :    : since it might be relevant to us right now.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Supposedly, grilling up lamprey has the effect of improving
 :    : eyesight when eaten. I say supposedly, but this isn't something that's
 :    : been documented in great detail.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]If you can find some of the Grilled Lamprey on this
 :    : floor, you may be able to restore your vision.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]But, I don't think it'll last for too long... This darkness is
 :    : abnormally thick, almost like a fog.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Chances are, once the lamprey fully digests, you'll have
 :    : difficulty seeing again.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]I wish I could give you an accurate estimate of how long
 :    : before it'll wear off... But I can't imagine it lasting longer than seven
 :    : battles at the most.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]That... really isn't a lot of time, not when you factor in 
 :    : wild Puppets.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Correct. I would also guess that you can't consume
 :    : more than one dish at a time. You would need to wait for
 :    : the first one to wear off before being able to eat more.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]If that's true, whoever caused this darkness must really
 :    : have it out for us.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]Keep yourself sharp, \pn. In the darkness, you
 :    : never know what is waiting to strike.

@>Text: \xn[Shinji]I'll be at Ms. Keine's Quiz Hall. I feel like testing my 
 :    : knowledge and seeing if my history lessons have paid off.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]There isn't much that's open on the first day that I'm 
 :    : interested in, so I might just bounce between stalls for today.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]I'm interested in checking out the Village Tournament, 
 :    : but that being said, I think there's one thing everyone has 
 :    : their eye on...
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]You mean Miss Minoriko's stand, don't you?
@>Text: \xn[Kota]I did hear that she was going to be selling homemade
 :    : Youkai Mountain delacacies.
@>Text: \xn[Maya]I'm more interested in the lottery she's holding,
 :    : and the prospect of a "special reward".
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]That does seem to be the talk of the festival. Currently,
 :    : it doesn't seem as if anybody has managed to claim this reward.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]It also doesn't seem this is an exclusive reward,
 :    : so it seems like multiple people will be able to win...
 :    : whatever it is.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]It's basically been the talk of the festival. Though, Miss
 :    : Minoriko claims it isn't some elaborate prize, it'll still be a very
 :    : worthwhile one.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]I'd be interested in checking it out later when we're
 :    : all available to, as it doesn't seem like she's finished setting up
 :    : the stall right now.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]I wouldn't be opposed to it either.
@>Text: \xn[Maya]Nor would I! So, I nominate \pn to come and find us
 :    : once she's ready!
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Wait, why me!
@>Text: \xn[Maya]If you're going to be participating in the Tournament,
 :    : we can't very well just pull you out of it, you know?
@>Text: \xn[Kota]Short of Maya helping out at Mr. Kirisame's shop,
 :    : all of our activities can kinda be dropped at a moment's
 :    : notice.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]I... suppose that makes sense, yeah I can get
 :    : behind that logic.
@>Text: \xn[Maya]So, let's recap then where we'll be so \pn remembers
 :    : where to find us!
@>Text: \xn[Maya]I'll be loitering around here, provided I'm not helping out
 :    : at Mr. Kirisame's shop.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]I'll probably be loitering around here as well, or over
 :    : at one of the various stands.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]I will be at Miss Keine's Quiz Hall for most of the
 :    : day.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Alright... I think I got it. I'll come get you guys once I'm ready then!

@>Show Animation: Player, [Exclaim bubble]
@>Text: \xn[\pn]A battle you say?
@>Text: \xn[Maya]Oh dear, looks like \pn is having thoughts again!
@>Text: \xn[\pn]What!? Can you really blame me if I like battling!
@>Text: \xn[Kota]Well, don't get your hopes up too high. So far, nobody
 :    : has managed to win that prize.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]Her stand has been seeing people constantly lining up
 :    : for it since it opened, and not a single customer has won yet.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]And this isn't some one-time grand prize, right?
 :    : Anybody can win it so long as they haven't won it yet?
@>Text: \xn[Kota]Precisely. Though, knowing \pn's luck, she'll probably
 :    : win it on her first purchase.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]I hate that I can't say you're wrong, even if I wouldn't 
 :    : mind...
@>Text: \xn[Maya]Well, even if we don't win it, I assume we could still
 :    : relegate the prize in her direction, yes?
@>Text: \xn[Maya]That would account for if someone purchased a jar,
 :    : but weren't actually Puppet handlers.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]Yep! More precisely, the winner can choose if
 :    : they want to battle Miss Minoriko, or if they want to give
 :    : the battle to someone else.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]This gets around the issue of a return customer
 :    : getting the prize a second time.
@>Text: \xn[Shinji]And since \pn is the one with the most battle
 :    : experience of us all here, and would most enjoy it, I see
 :    : no issues with giving it to her.
@>Text: \xn[Kota]I'm in agreement!

@>Text: \xn[Keine]So, first off, well done on returning with Miss
 :    : Kagiyama, \pn. I knew it was a good idea to trust in you.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Aw, you flatter me! But really, it was my pleasure
 :    : to be of help.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]So, what exactly is going on with the Village? I hit the
 :    : Village entrance and I see fairies charging through the roads.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Well, not long after you left, we started seeing more
 :    : and more fairies in the Village.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Initially, we thought these fairies could have been
 :    : responsible for the curse laid on the village, but that would
 :    : have been extremely out of character for them.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Still, we kept an eye on them as best we could.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]However, we were starting to notice that there were
 :    : more fairies than we could reasonably keep track of.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be an 
 :    : issue. Fairies tnd to frequent the village fairly often.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Right. But, the problems started arising when the 
 :    : Fairies begun to do coordinated pranks and challenge 
 :    : Puppet Handlers to battles in swarms.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]This wouldn't seem like an issue, but whenever one 
 :    : was dealt with, another three took its place.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]While most of the festival-goers are just assuming
 :    : this is part of the festival, a lot of villagers are understandably
 :    : concerned.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]Fairies are known to play pranks on the villagers,
 :    : but on such a scale is practically unheard of, even with all 
 :    : my years of writing for the Chronicle.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]This does sound like the situation in the Great
 :    : Youkai Forest. 
@>Text: \xn[Hina]The area of the Forest that I reside in is home to
 :    : malevolent spirits and lingering curses, nothing abnormal.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]However, as of recent, the spirits there begun to
 :    : act up, possessing the local Puppets and causing general
 :    : mayhem.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]It's getting to the point where they can impersonate
 :    : others and command Puppets! Fortunately, \pn was here to help 
 :    : deal with the situation.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]The similarities in our situations leads me to believe
 :    : that they are connected.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]Miss Kamishirasawa, you said that the Village is 
 :    : currently cursed, correct?
@>Text: \xn[Keine]According to this letter we recieved, at least. Though,
 :    : I see little else to explain our crops suddenly withering and
 :    : becoming inedible.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]That would line up with the aura of misfortune I felt
 :    : upon entering the Village, and further supports my theory.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Would you care to elaborate?
@>Text: \xn[Hina]It's really quite simple! The Village being cursed is
 :    : what links together the fairies and spirits being more
 :    : aggressive than usual.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]However, normally, a curse would only affect its
 :    : specific target.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]For it to rebound and affect areas outside of the 
 :    : Village, that would imply that the person who laid the curse 
 :    : has no experience with curses.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]It's something I'm quite accustomed to seeing, an
 :    : inexperienced individual casting a curse and having it rebound
 :    : in horrific, unexpected ways.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]We're lucky that this curse doesn't seem to have
 :    : rebounded in any sort of malignant way... At least, not that
 :    : we know of.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]I suppose that is a silver lining of sorts...
@>Text: \xn[Keine]So, do you have a solution in mind?
@>Text: \xn[Hina]Well, first I'll need to examine the Village more to find
 :    : the focal point of the curse. From there, I can begin dismantling 
 :    : it.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]As for the fairies, if they are indeed aflicted the same 
 :    : way as the spirits in the Forest are, simply defeating them in 
 :    : battle should get them to calm down... if only temporarily.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]I can help deal with the fairies, it shouldn't be that hard 
 :    : of a task.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Is there somewhere in specific I should go?
@>Text: \xn[Keine]There is, actually!
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Directly east of the Festival Grounds is where a
 :    : rather large congregation of Fairies have been spotted.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Taking care of them will go a long way in preventing
 :    : more from swooping into the village.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]While that's going on, I will go on patrol with
 :    : Miss Kagiyama and try to find where the curse is at its
 :    : strongest in the Village.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Directly east of the Village, so the farmlands and
 :    : Village Outskirts... Alright, shouldn't be a problem.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]I shall return to scouring the Chronicle,

@>Text: \xn[\pn]Wow, already? That was pretty fast!
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Well, there's really only one person who fits that

@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]Her name is Medicine Melancholy. She's a doll that
 :    : lives on the Nameless Hill. As a relatively newborn Youkai with
 :    : little control over her own power and emotions, she is extremely
 :    : dangerous.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]Since her birth, she's had poor relation with Humans
 :    : she's come into contact with. 
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]This is because of her own origins as a Youkai.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]Medicine was once a regular doll, used by a one in
 :    : the ventriloquist profession.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]It is unknown how it happened, but at some point
 :    : she wound up abandoned on Nameless Hill, surounded by
 :    : the poisonous Suzuran flowers.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]As a result of that, when she was reborn as a
 :    : Youkai, she gained the ability to manipulate and utilize
 :    : poisons.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]Because of her abandonment, she has grown
 :    : resentful toward Humans.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]Reports from the Yama claim that she sought 
 :    : to liberate dolls to prevent them from suffering the same 
 :    : fate she fell to.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]It is believed that with time, she will eventually
 :    : settle down properly, like most other Youkai in Gensokyo
 :    : do.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]However, while she has little control over her
 :    : own powers, it is ill advised to approach her, even if you
 :    : know what you're doing.

@>Text: \xn[Hina]This reinforces my theory, though! Given that it 
 :    : is Medicine who sent the letter, she will likely try to attack
 :    : the Village.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]Especially once she realizes that the curse has
 :    : been taken down.
@>Text: \xn[Minoriko]While it is possible she may try to curse the Village 
 :    : again, a direct attack seems in the cards if she does in fact 
 :    : have an army of Puppets.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Then, is there anything we can do?
@>Text: \xn[Keine]I had proposed setting up defenses along the border 
 :    : wall in case an attack did in fact happen.
@>Text: \xn[Hina]However, if Medicine has a way to plant curses on
 :    : the Village, then it's possible she can take down those defenses
 :    : without ever getting close to the Village.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Then what options do we have at our disposal? Surely
 :    : you aren't suggesting we sit back and allow her to take over the
 :    : Village?
@>Text: \xn[Hina]Of course not! But if Medicine is the problem, we have 
 :    : to make her be the solution somehow.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]Hmm... It might be possible to reason with her.
@>Set Move Route: [Keine]

@>Text: \xn[Keine]You yourself said that she detests Humanity, would 
 :    : she truly be open to reason?
@>Set Move Route: [Akyuu]

@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]It's not entirely off the table. Further reports from
 :    : the Yama also say that while she thought to liberate dolls at
 :    : one point, she was disuaded from pursuing that objective.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Evidently not permanently.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]No, but we don't need it to be permanently.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]Right now she is akin to a child throwing a tantrum.
 :    : Eventually she will grow, like the other Youkai have, and likely
 :    : abandon plans altogether for subjugation of Humans.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]But for now, if we can get her to abandon her plans,
 :    : if only temporarily, we buy more time until the eventual day 
 :    : when she does settle down and abandons it permanently.
@>Set Move Route: [Akyuu]
 :              : $>Turn Down
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]In this case, I propose we send \pn to deal with 
 :    : it.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]I'm not surprised it's come back to me, but... why
 :    : me, specifically?
@>Set Move Route: [Keine]
 :              : $>Turn Down
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]The way I see it is that Medicine harbors a grudge
 :    : against Humanity for their mistreatment of her kin- of dolls, of
 :    : Puppets.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]You are the complete antithesis to her beliefs. You
 :    : have forged a strong bond with your Puppets, one based on
 :    : trust and friendship.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]Tell me, \pn. Do you plan to abandon your Puppets 
 :    : when the going gets tough? When they no longer can win in 
 :    : battles like they used to?
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Well... No, not in the slightest! They're my friends,
 :    : afterall! We work as one cohesive unit, and where one
 :    : falls behind, the rest help to back them up!
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]Precisely! Medicine is hurt by trauma, and that trauma
 :    : won't go away easily- if ever.
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]But, it might be possible to show her your bond
 :    : with your Puppets, and that might be enough to get her to
 :    : surrender.
@>Set Move Route: [Keine]
 :              : $>Turn Right
@>Text: \xn[Keine]You're putting a lot of stock into this one plan, Akyuu.
 :    : What do we do if it fails?
@>Set Move Route: [Akyuu]
 :              : $>Turn Left
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]I believe wholly in \pn's abilities, enough to know
 :    : that it won't fail.
@>Set Move Route: [Keine]

@>Set Move Route: [Akyuu]
 :              : $>Turn Down
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Haah... I suppose that's that, then.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]I was thinking similarly to Akyuu, but it is extremely 
 :    : risky. Medicine is a very dangerous individual.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Is this something you think you can handle, \pn?
@>Text: \xn[\pn]I think I can, but... the Suzuran field is full of poisons,
 :    : right? How am I supposed to actually survive being there?
@>Text: \xn[Minoriko]Just leave that to me, dear!
@>Text: \xn[Minoriko]My blessings will allow you to navigate the thick
 :    : miasmas that permeate the Suzuran Field.
@>Text: \xn[Minoriko]You will be fine, however I can't entirely vouch
 :    : for your Puppets...
@>Text: \xn[Minoriko]The longer they're exposed and battling, the more 
 :    : prone they might be to sucumbing to some form of ailments.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Well, that settles my only worry. I guess my next 
 :    : question is...\wt[10] How do I get to the Suzuran Field?
@>Text: \xn[Akyuu]You can usually reach the Nameless Hill by going
 :    : east of the Forest of Magic and heading north at the
 :    : crossroads leading to the Sanzu River.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]However, I suspect that Medicine will be expecting
 :    : some sort of retalliation. It's likely that some sort of barrier or
 :    : defensive line has been set up along that path.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]There is a second path, but it requires taking a less
 :    : direct route via the Misty Lake.
@>Text: \xn[Keine]It's not likely that Medicine will have accounted
 :    : for someone crossing the river to go all the way around.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]So, I just gotta ask Nitori for a ferry ride across the
 :    : lake again. Alright, that shouldn't be too hard!
@>Text: \xn[Keine]We rely on you so much, but just once more...
@>Text: \xn[Keine]Good luck, \pn. The whole of the Human Village
 :    : is resting on your shoulders with this.

 @>Text: \xn[Merlin]You'll be allowed to take your own Puppet Orbs in

 @>Text: \xn[Merlin]No, nothing as serious as what's going on at the

 @>Text: \xn[Merlin]Essentially, your Puppets will be aflicted with status
  :    : conditions, which'll make battling much more difficult.
 @>Text: \xn[Merlin]Or, you might get unlucky and the enemy Puppet
  :    : is much stronger than usual!
 @>Text: \xn[Merlin]Though, perhaps you could get lucky and the

 @>Text: \xn[\pn]The same could be said of us Humans who use

 @>Text: \xn[\pn]The same could be said of us Humans who use

 @>Text: \xn[\pn]Sure, there are some of my kind that are malicious

 @>Text: \xn[\pn]And perhaps you might have even been able to

 @>Text: \xn[\pn]No! No Human is going to want to subjugate or control

 @>Text: \xn[\pn]All I'm saying is to consider that the malicious Humans 
  :    : you've seen and experienced are a very small group.
 @>Text: \xn[\pn]At the very least, if you can't trust in Humans as a
  :    : whole to be kind and compasionate, put your trust in me.
 @>Text: \xn[\pn]Sure, I'm just some random nobody from the Village,
  :    : especially when compared to the likes of the regular Incident
  :    : Solvers, but I'd like to believe I'm at least somewhat

 @>Text: \xn[\pn]Thank you!

@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Tell me, \pn. You know why I called you here today,
 :    : correct?
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Well, if memory serves correctly, the letter said that you
 :    : wished to battle me.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Precisely. You see, \pn, I've heard about you and 
 :    : your talents.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]It's not very often that one can just brave the
 :    : curse-filled domain of the Great Youkai Forest, or the
 :    : miasma-laden Suzuran Field and walk away unscathed.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Especially when one is dealing with a fledgling Youkai
 :    : such as Medicine.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Not to mention, of course, being able to convince her 
 :    : to stand down. You must truly be something else to tackle all
 :    : of that!
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Thanks, I guess! I just did what had to be do-\.. Wait 
 :    : a second.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]How did you know about my battle with Medicine?
@>Text: \xn[\pn]I didn't include that in my interview with the Tengu 
 :    : reporter, and Miss Keine instructed me to keep that under 
 :    : wraps until further notice.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]When one lives so close to the home of the person
 :    : who was plotting to curse and overrun the Village, one tends to
 :    : overhear many interesting things.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]Wait, so you knew all along that Medicine was behind
 :    : the incident in the Village?
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Well of course I did! It made for quite the interesting
 :    : series of events.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]So... If you knew, how come you didn't mention it to 
 :    : anyone in the Village?
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Well that's really quite simple to answer.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]You see, the affairs of what happens in the Human 
 :    : Village mean very little to me.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]I couldn't care less what happens to them, be it good 
 :    : or bad.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]I could go to bed one evening with the Village 
 :    : perfectly safe, then wake up the next and overhear that it's 
 :    : been destroyed by some malevolent Youkai.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]And it wouldn't mean a thing to me.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]...I... That's...
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Oh, come now! Did you forget? I'm a Youkai! We
 :    : are Humanity's greatest predator.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Sure, I might not lift a finger to harm the Village, but 
 :    : that doesn't mean I'll lift a finger to <i>protect</i> it, either.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Well, not unless something about what's befalling it 
 :    : interests me personally, of course.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]\b(Yep! Okay! She's every bit as terrifying as the stories
 :    : make her out to be! I don't even know what to say here!)
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Getting back to the original topic...
@>Text: \xn[\pn]\b(And she immediately topic shifts without a second 
 :    : thought, too! Elder Youkai really are something else entirely...)
@>Fade Out BGM: 15 sec.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]You see, \pn. After hearing all of these stories about
 :    : you, I am very interested in what you can do.
@>Text: \xn[\pn]In... what I can do? I'm just a simple Human, what 
 :    : <i>can</i> I do that has you so interested in me?
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]I've seen many a trainer in the outside world with
 :    : command over Puppets, exceptional command over them.
 :    : Much like you, even.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]These individuals have toppled organisations left and
 :    : right with their mastery over Puppets.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Of course, I try not to interact with the Outside World 
 :    : too much. Gensokyo and the Outside World were separated for a
 :    : reason, afterall!
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]And it wouldn't do for a Youkai like me to suddenly
 :    : start terrorizing the Humans beyond the barrier.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]This has left me yearning for a chance to test my
 :    : skills against a trainer of equal calibur here in Gensokyo.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]And, to my surprise, I wouldn't have to wait too long!
@>Text: \xn[\pn]You mean me, of course. But am I really that strong?
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]Oh make no mistake, \pn. You are absolutely one
 :    : of the strongest trainers in Gensokyo right now.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]...At least, among the ordinary folk. Which is what 
 :    : makes you so fascinating. As well as what made me reach out
 :    : to you for a battle.
@>Play BGM: 'P-004. Sleeping Terror', 100, 100
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]I appreciate strength in an individual. Power. 
 :    : Determination. And you exude all of that.
@>Text: \xn[Yuuka]You don't rely on cheap tricks to win. Just your own
 :    : strength, and the strength of your Puppets.

@>Show Choices: Touhou Series, Touhoumon 1.8, No thanks
(When Cancel: Choice 3)
: When [Touhou Series]
 @>Text: Touhou Project is a doujin series produced by ZUN of Team
  :    : Shanghai Alice. The official games are traditionally of the 
  :    : 2D-style shoot-em-up genre, with the occasional break for
  :    : fighting games.
 @>Text: There is also an amalgamate of print works and Music CDs 
  :    : that are officially released by Team Shanghai Alice.
 @>Text: The setting is Gensokyo, a haunted region of Japan, that houses 
  :    : Humans, Youkai, Gods, and other supernatural and  mythical
  :    : entities.
 @>Text: The plot of these games is self contained, usually not
  :    : connecting to future or past games aside from one-off
  :    : references, unless otherwise part of an arc.
 @>Text: As such, there is no definitive "order" to playing the games.
 @>Text: They usually revolve around the protagonists, Reimu Hakurei
  :    : and Marisa Kirisame, traveling through 6 normal stages, 
  :    : attempting to resolve the current incident of the game.
 @>Text: Incidents such as the Scarlet Mist incident, the Divine Spirits 
  :    : incident, the Urban Legend incident, and the Second Genso-Lunar
  :    : War, just to name a few.

: When [Touhoumon 1.8]
 @>Text: Touhoumon Generation 1.8 was a radical shift in the Touhoumon department.
  :    : It was the introduction of several new concepts, and mechanics. The
  :    : most notable addition was the Diamond/Pearl Skill Split System, or
  :    : as it's called in English communities, the Physical/Special Split.
 @>Text: Alongside the Physical/Special Split came a completely overhauled 
  :    : type chart, featuring several new types that weren't in Pokemon 
  :    : (Such as Faith, Dream, Illusion, Heart), and replacing some of the 
  :    : older types with the new ones (Like Dragon, Bug, Normal, and Fighting).
 @>Text: The 1.8 Generation also had a more streamlined evolution system. Unlike 
  :    : the previous Touhoumon generations, where Touhoumon would evolve in 3 Stages 
  :    : (Chibi-Normal-EX), with some special evolutions, (Final, Advent, Last Word, this 
  :    : system had Touhoumon evolve from Chibi into several different forms.
 @>Text: A vast majority of Puppets have Shard Evolutions, which evolve them 
  :    : into specialized forms, such as Attack Forms, Defense Forms, and Speed Forms.
 @>Text: There are other, more non-specific, stone roles, such as  Helper Forms, 
  :    : Technical Forms, and Advent Forms. These roles cover a much different 
  :    : playstyle than the basic Attack, Defense, and Speed roles.
 @>Text: Provided with the game is a Type Chart in the traditional and 
  :    : streamlined format, both present in the Useful Stuff folder, as
  :    : well as an explanation file for how to rationalize the type chart,
  :    : made by DoesntKnowHowToPlay.
